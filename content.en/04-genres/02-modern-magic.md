# Modern Magic

The following optional rules allow you to add a magical flavor to your modern setting.

## Modern Magic Flavors

### Charms and Figments Flavor

Creating illusions and affecting minds are sometimes considered “soft” magical disciplines (as opposed to “hard” disciplines that manipulate energy or physical matter). It’s common for a character with an interest in one to learn a few spells in the other.

#### Tier 1

**Background Music (1+ Intellect points):** You create quiet background music in a short area, loud enough to be heard in a room with normal conversation, but not so loud to be distracting or overwhelming. The music repeats through up to ten songs you know, lasting up to an hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort adds one hour to the play time and five songs to the playlist. Action.

**Fast Talk**

**Goad**

**Impart Ideal**

**Mental Link**

**Minor Illusion**

#### Tier 2

**Calm Stranger**

**Cloud Personal Memories**

**Illusory Duplicate**

**Misdirect Blame**

#### Tier 3

**Advanced Command**

**Illusory Disguise**

**Soothe the Savage**

#### Tier 4

**Calm**

**Major Illusion**

**Mind Control**

**Psychic Burst**

**Psychic Suggestion**

#### Tier 5

**Crowd Control**

**Mind Games**

**Projection**

#### Tier 6

**Flee**

**Terrifying Image**

### Cozy Magic Flavor

Sometimes a sorcerer isn’t interested in combat magic and secret of the universe. Sometimes “cozy magic” is enough: bonding with a group of close friends, having a nice house, and providing support and comfort in times of need.

#### Tier 1

**Advice From A Friend**

**Check Status (0+ Intellect points):** You can telepathically reach out to up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. The individual creatures must be willing and able to communicate. You immediately know their current status—eating, driving, sleeping, angry, injured, fine, great, frightened, worried, and so on, generally in the form of a short sentence or a few words.

These creatures don’t have to share anything they don’t want to, including acknowledging that you checked on them, but they can’t lie through this connection. For example, one person might let you know that they’re upset, but that doesn’t mean you know why (they’re dealing with a recent breakup) or what they’re doing about it (drinking to cope).

You automatically succeed at using this ability; no roll is required. Only you receive the status information. Other people affected by the spell do not get a sense of each other’s statuses, nor do they know who else you’re checking on.

If you spend 5 Intellect points, you can check on twenty creatures at once, and for every 1 Intellect point you spend above that, you can check on an additional ten creatures. Action.

**Comfort and Encouragement (2+ Intellect points):** You speak to a non-hostile creature within short range, telling them exactly what they need to hear to have a better day. You don’t know what these words are until you say them, but you know they will help the creature’s attitude. If the creature spends a round or two thinking about what you said, they gain an asset on one task of their choosing within one hour. Alternatively, if the creature has an ongoing penalty to tasks (such as having a hangover, sadness from a recent fight with their romantic partner, an injury, or a stressful situation at work), they can ignore that penalty for the next hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more creatures; each level of Effort affects one additional creature. Action to initiate; up to one minute to complete.

**Gift of Appeasement (2+ Intellect points):** You conjure a trifle that can fit in one hand and will please a creature within immediate range. The object is impractical and inexpensive, but delightful to the creature. Examples include their favorite kind of cookie, a small crafted coffee beverage, or a paper origami of their favorite animal. You don’t know what the spell will create, but you know it will please them if you give it as a gift. If the creature spends one minute appreciating the object (such as eating the cookie, drinking the coffee, or examining the origami), they gain an asset on one task of their choosing within one hour.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more creatures; each level of Effort affects one additional creature. Action per target to initiate.

#### Tier 2

**Emotional Support Pet (3+ Intellect points):** You conjure an adorable animal that most people find irresistibly cute, such as a puppy, kitten, or bunny, who is outgoing and friendly and otherwise acts according to its nature. Anyone in short range who can see the animal eases their defense tasks against negative feelings (such as anger, fear, sadness, and worry) for the next hour. Anyone who pets, cuddles, or plays with this animal for at least a round or two (up to four people can do so at once) feels happier for the next hour and adds +1 to any recovery rolls they make during that time. At the end of the spell, the conjured animal curls up, falls asleep, and disappears in a puff of smoke. If the animal is harmed in any way, anyone who saw it happen eases all rolls against the creature responsible for the harm. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can conjure three additional animals for each level of Effort you apply to this ability. Action.

**Adorable Animal:** level 1, positive social interactions as level 3

**Fetch**

**Safe Sex (2 Intellect points):** One creature you touch can have sexual encounters with no chance of causing pregnancy or transmitting an STI. This protection lasts for ten hours. Action.

**Spectral Servant (2 Intellect points):** You conjure a spectral servant, a semi-real magical construct that resembles the vague nonthreatening outline of a person. It is more of an extension of your will than a separate being, and it automatically assists you in simple tasks like bringing drinks to houseguests and dealing with chores. It cannot attack or defend, and it vanishes if you are ever more than a short distance from it. The servant lasts for one hour before disappearing. Action.

**Telepathic**

#### Tier 3

**Informer**

**Laundry Day (3+ Intellect points):** You select two batches of laundry within immediate range, each large enough for a typical washing machine or dryer. The laundry agitates and spins in midair for a minute, becoming clean and dry as it does so, after which it sorts and stacks itself into neat piles or, if you know where it belongs and that’s within short range, putting itself away. Particularly dirty clothes automatically take a few extra minutes to finish cleaning and drying. The spell doesn’t harm delicate items or clothing that needs special care (such as dry cleaning or low temperature). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more batches of laundry; each level of Effort affects two additional batches. Action to initiate; one minute to complete.

**Spring Cleaning (3+ Intellect points):** You choose a short area, such as a typical room in a house, two rooms in a small apartment, or two automobiles. Over the next few minutes, the area is thoroughly cleaned—floors are swept, vacuumed, or mopped; surfaces like countertops and sinks are wiped down with a gentle soap and disinfectant; and so on. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the area or clean more quickly; each level of Effort affects an additional short area or reduces the cleaning time from minutes to rounds. Action.

#### Tier 4

**Able Assistance**

**Pay it Forward**

**Thinking Ahead**

#### Tier 5

**Group Friendship**

**Undo**

#### Tier 6

**Drawing on Life’s Experiences**

**Stimulate**

**Telepathic Network**

### Divination Flavor

Knowledge is power! Characters with the divination flavor are familiar with using magic to learn information, see into hidden places, and discover secrets.

#### Tier 1

**Babel**

**Scan**

**Third Eye**

#### Tier 2

**Diagnose Device (2 Intellect points):** You ease by two steps the task to diagnose what’s wrong with a human-made electronic or mechanical device or system (such as a computer, clothes dryer, or toilet) that is damaged, malfunctioning, or broken. You must touch the device to diagnose it. Typically a successful roll means that you learn the main problem and its cause. For example, you could learn that a bricked phone is infected with malware, a pipe is clogged with “flushable” wipes, or a rattling engine needs motor oil. This ability is unreliable at best when used on alien, high-technology, or other mysterious devices. Action.

**Mind Reading**

**Open Mind**

**Premonition**

**See History**

#### Tier 3

**Creature Insight**

**Device Insight**

**Question Past Self (4+ Intellect points):** You reach into the past up to a week and mentally ask your past self one or two questions about something you knew or observed at the chosen time. For example, if you’ve forgotten an important phone number or can’t remember if a particular person was in a meeting, you can ask your past self about it while it’s still fresh in your past self ’s memory. Your past self doesn’t perceive this as an intrusive voice—it just seems like an unexpected moment of reflection about the questions your present self asks. This doesn’t allow you to remember things your past self didn’t actually know at the time, but it can sometimes help your present self (in the form of an asset) learn more about or realize something your past self wasn’t really paying attention to at the time (such as seeing part of a password or noting whether there was a red delivery truck nearby). For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can reach an additional week further into the past. Action.

**Retrieve Memories**

#### Tier 4

**Reading the Room**

**Remote Viewing**

**Sensor**

#### Tier 5

**Knowing the Unknown**

**Read the Signs**

**True Sense**

#### Tier 6

**See Through Time**

### Modern Magic Flavor

Characters who live in a modern world with magic and technology often know a bit about mixing the two of them together. These characters usually pick up a few useful spells (such as disrupting hostile magic or disabling a mugger’s pistol) from various sources, much like how people tend to learn skills unrelated to their day job (like cooking, dancing, and playing guitar).

#### Tier 1

**Cantrips (choose any four)**

**Annoy Electronics (1 Intellect point):** You interfere with the operations of an electronic device. The device must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Your interference is limited to things you could do in a few seconds if you were directly using the device. For example, you could make a person’s phone start playing a loud video, type one or two commands on a computer’s keyboard, hit a bunch of buttons in an elevator, or change the station or volume on a television screen. You must succeed at an Intellect-based task against the device or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you have never interacted with the particular device before, the task is hindered by two steps. Action.

**Arcanaphone (2 Intellect points):** You make use of your cellular service to start a telephone call or use text messaging, lasting up to ten minutes. To anyone watching you, you look like you’re in “hands free” mode. In all respects, this works as if you were carrying your device with you and using it directly (meaning the network notes your current location as if you were carrying your phone, and you may not have coverage in some areas). The first time you use this ability with your mobile service, you must contact their customer service department to authorize the magic (taking ten to sixty minutes), as if it were a new device. You can’t use this ability if you don’t have a cellular account. Action to initiate.

In modern fantasy settings where most people don’t know about magic, connecting your spell to your cellular service probably requires a lot of strange answers and lies about the “device” you’re trying to add to your account.

**Enhance Athletics (2 Intellect points):** You enhance the ability of one creature to perform certain athletic sports tasks. The creature must be within long range and visible to you. For the next minute, the creature can apply one free level of Effort to any one task to catch, hit, kick, or throw an object, or to any one climbing, jumping, or running task. Once this free level of Effort is used, the magic ends. Action.

**Mage Clock:** You can mentally connect to a universal magical clock, allowing you to know the local time, down to a tenth of a second. You can have up to three magical timers at once, each of which sounds a mental alarm after an amount of time you specify or at a specific time (such as nine minutes from now, three hours from now, or 8 o’clock in the morning). Action.

**Spellpay (1 Intellect point):** You initiate a transaction with another person or business cashier within short range, giving them an amount of money that you specify. The currency comes from cash in your possession, money in your account, or a mix of both; the recipient receives this money in the same form as it came from you. For example, if you send someone \$150, \$50 of which is cash in your wallet and \$100 of which comes from your bank account, they suddenly have \$50 cash on hand and \$100 in their bank account. Instead of a transaction between two people, you can instead use this ability to access your account, withdrawing or depositing cash as if using a teller machine. Action.

Spellpay can access any monetary account you use, such as a checking or savings account through a bank or credit union, or a mobile payment service such as Apple Pay, PayPal, or Venmo

**Ward**

#### Tier 2

**Charm Machine**

**Dispel Magic (2+ Intellect points):** Choose one magical effect within long range. An effect of up to level 3 ends if you succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the level of the effect, or against the level of the creature or object the magical effect affects, whichever is higher. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can apply Effort to increase the level of the effect that can potentially be dispelled. Action.

**Gun Jammer (2+ Intellect points):** You can interfere with a firearm so the next time it is used, it jams or misfires. The weapon must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Make an Intellect-based attack against the weapon or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you succeed, the next attack with the firearm fails, and the weapon won’t fire until someone uses an action to correct the problem. If you activate this ability when it isn’t your turn, your attack against the weapon is hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more firearms; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action or enabler.

**Magical Power Current (2+ Intellect points):** You provide electricity to a device that runs on standard house current, such as a laptop computer, circular saw, or microwave oven, allowing it to function as if plugged in for one hour. The cost is 2 Intellect points plus 1 point per level of the device. Action.

**Safe Fall**

**Safe Sex (2 Intellect points):** One creature you touch can have sexual encounters with no chance of causing pregnancy or transmitting an STI. This protection lasts for ten hours. Action.

**Third Eye**

#### Tier 3

**Diagnose Device (2 Intellect points):** You ease by two steps the task to diagnose what’s wrong with a human-made electronic or mechanical device or system (such as a computer, clothes dryer, or toilet) that is damaged, malfunctioning, or broken. You must touch the device to diagnose it. Typically a successful roll means that you learn the main problem and its cause. For example, you could learn that a bricked phone is infected with malware, a pipe is clogged with “flushable” wipes, or a rattling engine needs motor oil. This ability is unreliable at best when used on alien, high-technology, or other mysterious devices. Action.

**Network Tap**

**Sensor**

#### Tier 4

**Repair Machine (3+ Intellect points):** You automatically repair one broken device of up to level 4 that you touch, restoring it to full working condition. This ability works only if at least 80 percent of the original device is still on hand. The device may still need fuel, oil, or other substances that aid its operation but are not part of the electronics or mechanism. This ability only reliably works on human-crafted devices and tends to fail when used on alien, high-technology, or otherwise mysterious machines. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the target level that can be affected by 1. Action.

**Soothe the Savage**

#### Tier 5

**Granite Wall**

**Tower of Will**

#### Tier 6

**Information Gathering**

**Trust to Luck**

### Protection Flavor

Characters with the protection flavor use magic to defend against hostile environments, hazardous substances, dangerous creatures, and intrusive mental powers.

#### Tier 1

**Closed Mind**

**Resonance Field**

**Ward**

#### Tier 2

**Safe Sex (2 Intellect points):** One creature you touch can have sexual encounters with no chance of causing pregnancy or transmitting an STI. This protection lasts for ten hours. Action.

**Trained Without Armor**

**Wind Armor**

#### Tier 3

**Energy Protection**

**Force Field Barrier**

**Unstealable Charm (3+ Intellect points):** An object you are holding, touching, or wearing becomes more difficult to steal; attempts to remove it from your person without your knowledge or permission are hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can apply Effort to hinder such attempts by an additional step. The charm lasts for twenty-four hours. Action.

#### Tier 4

**Counter Danger**

**Elemental Protection**

**Poison Resistance**

#### Tier 5

**Defensive Field**

**Nothing but Defend**

**Tower of Intellect**

#### Tier 6

**Reactive Field**

**Untouchable**

## Modern Magic Character Options


### Descriptors

Most of these descriptors are for characters who are or become significantly nonhuman

nonhuman; for example, the Dragon descriptor means you’re a four-legged, winged dragon who can breathe flame. These descriptors include suggestions for how to advance or improve your inherent nature as that sort of creature (becoming even more dragonish if you are a Dragon, for example). The GM should allow a character with such a descriptor to choose any of these abilities (and any others the GM feels are appropriate for the descriptor) in place of a type ability, either upon advancing to a new tier or selecting them as an other option of character advancement by spending 4 XP.

**It’s Only Magic Descriptors:** Chimera, Dragon, Ghost, Hunter, Nix, Sylph, Unmagical


#### Chimera

You have a blend of animal attributes; you may be a well-known mythological creature,

like a satyr or minotaur, or you may have a unique combination of features. Bison horns,

boar tusks, bear paws, a wolf’s tail, a lion’s mane: take your pick. Your thickened skin offers

protection from attacks and the elements. Depending on your dexterity—and whether you

have opposable thumbs—you may use adaptive weapons and tools, like a dagger modified

to be held in a paw instead of a hand. You’re eager to protect the ones closest to you, and

usually more likely to run toward conflict than away from it.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Fur and Hide:** +1 to Armor.

**Animal Strength:** +1 to your Might Pool.

**Charging Ahead:** You’re trained in initiative.

**For the Gang:** You stick up for your friends. When you draw the attack, your defense is only hindered by one step.

Ham-fisted: Tasks requiring fine motor skills are hindered.


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. A herd, a pride, a pack, a flock: whatever the collective noun for chimeras is, you’re looking to build (or join) one.

2. You need supplies to adapt a legendary weapon perfectly to your physique.

3. The other PCs were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you protected them from harm.

4. You were held hostage by someone running a chimera fighting ring, and the other PCs freed you.


**Chimera Advancement:**

Athlete

Dual Light Wield

Enhanced Might

Enhanced Speed

Fists of Fury

Frenzy


#### Dragon

You can shift at will between a dragon and humanoid form; you may choose to spend more time in one form or the other. In your dragon form you’re about 10 feet (3.5 m) long with four legs, leathery wings, and a serpentlike tail. You’re drawn to treasure and shiny things, but you’re willing to share your hoard with those you trust. Though you can speak human languages, you can’t ignore the fact that you’re a wild part of your local ecosystem—at least some of the time. You’re an apex predator, driven to fly and to hunt, and you brumate in cold temperatures like other reptiles.

Brumation is a state of sluggishness and inactivity entered by reptiles in response to low temperatures.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Dragon Form:** You have both a humanoid form and a dragon form, and you can switch forms up to four times in a 24-hour period. In dragon form, your Speed defense tasks are hindered due to your size. Enabler.

**Tough:** +2 to your Might Pool.

**Fireproof:** +2 Armor against damage inflicted by fire or heat.

**Wings (1 Might point):** When you have wings, you can fly a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action, for up to ten minutes total. Enabler.

**Teeth:** You are skilled in making unarmed bite attacks, which are a medium weapon in your dragon form and a light weapon in. your humanoid form. Enabler.

**Spitting Flames (1+ Might point):** You can breathe a ball of fire at a target within short range, inflicting 3 points of fire damage. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action.

**Inability:** Cold weather makes you want to burrow somewhere cozy and go dormant. Speed tasks are hindered when the temperature falls below 50°F (10°C).


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. The other PCs were hired as dragon hunters, but once they met you they realized their mission was misguided.

2. You’re hoping to find a specific discontinued currency to add to your hoard.

3. You got stuck in your dragon form while molting, and the other PCs helped remove your shed skin.

4. You’re gathering ingredients for a difficult spell that will increase the range and intensity of your fire-breathing attacks.


**Dragon Advancement:**

Danger Sense

Defensive Field

Enhanced Might

Enhanced Might Edge

Enlarge

Training in Spitting Flames


#### Ghost

Unfortunately, you’re dead. But hey, it’s not all bad! Your spirit has remained in the mortal world. You can still walk among the living, but you no longer need pesky things like food or sleep. It’s up to you how long you’ve been dead, whether you remember your death, and why you’ve stuck around: seeking revenge, settling a debt, protecting your descendants, perfecting your great-grandma’s pecan pie recipe, or something else entirely.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Ghostly Wisdom:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Sneaky:** You’re trained in stealth and intimidation.

**Incorporeal:** You’re trained in Speed defense.

**Calling the Dead:** You’re trained in communicating with other ghosts, wraiths, undead, and so on. You can also serve as a catalyst for communication with the dead, providing an asset to a living character attempting such a task (such as a séance or summoning).

**Insubstantial:** All physical attacks are hindered.

**Dead:** Positive social interaction tasks with living creatures are hindered.

**Uniform:** You’re permanently wearing the clothes you had on when you died. This can hinder social interactions if you’re inappropriately dressed for the setting (wearing a bathrobe and slippers to a formal party, for example).


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. You’re on a journey to make amends with someone you wronged in life.

2. You’re looking for the resting place of your physical body so you can be resurrected.

3. One of the other PCs is a distant relative, and you need to keep them alive so your bloodline continues.

4. You’re studying the secrets of reincarnation and suspect that one of the other PCs has vital information.


**Ghost Advancement:**

Duplicate

Question the Spirits

See the Unseen

Speaker for the Dead

Surprise Attack

Walk Through Walls


#### Hunter

**You once rode with the Wild Hunt:** an immortal cavalry who traversed the skies in secret each night, gathering the souls of those who died in battle and carrying them to the beyond. These days, the Wild Hunt has downsized and your nights are your own. You’re mortal again, too, but it’s impossible to forget the terrifying freedom and power you once held. Maybe you’ve let nostalgia make you bitter, or maybe you don’t miss the Hunt at all, instead living in fear of being conscripted once more.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Agile:** +2 to your Speed Pool.

**Equestrian:** You’re trained in handling and riding horses.

**Sword Hand:** You’re proficient with two-handed swords and can use them without penalty.

**Hearing the Dead:** You’re skilled in all social interactions with ghosts.

**The Call of the Hunt:** You’re often distracted by sounds that remind you of the Wild Hunt, such as horns and baying hounds. Tasks requiring concentration are hindered.

**Lost Years:** In the years you belonged to the Wild Hunt, you lost touch with advancing technology. Tasks involving computers, pop culture, and recent history are hindered.


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. You ferried the soul of a PC’s relative to the afterlife. When you left the Wild Hunt, you found the PC to tell them of their relative’s brave deeds.

2. The living only see the Wild Hunt cross the sky if they’re destined for disaster. A PC saw the Wild Hunt years ago, and you’ve taken it upon yourself to protect them.

3. You’re afraid that the leader of the Wild Hunt will summon you, and you need help concealing yourself.

4. You’re searching for the horse you remember riding—a massive undead stallion with flaming hooves.


#### Nix

You’re a shapeshifting water spirit. You can walk on two legs and breathe air, but when you’re submerged, you gain a tail, fins, and gills. You probably live near flowing water, with no preference for salinity or temperature; you also have a general affinity for nature and a knack for identifying useful plants. Your playful and upbeat disposition doesn’t mean you’re passive or helpless. Though you may prefer to talk your way out of tough situations, you’re quick to react to threats—especially in water, where you maneuver with deadly accuracy.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Transformation:** When submerged in water, you transform into a fish/human hybrid with gills, fins, sharp teeth, and a tail. This transformation is automatic. Enabler.

**Unchillable:** +2 Armor against damage caused by cold or ice.

**Sharp Teeth:** You are skilled in making an unarmed bite attack, which is a medium weapon in your aquatic form and a light weapon in your humanoid form. Enabler.

**Quick Swimming:** You can swim a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action.

**Close to Nature:** You’re skilled in identifying plants and animals.

**Siren Song:** You’re extremely charismatic. You’re skilled in persuasion and deception.

**Distractible:** You have a hard time focusing. You’re hindered in tasks involving knowledge or lore, as well as resisting mental attacks.

**Inability:** When you’re in water, attacks using weapons are hindered.


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. The other PCs were stranded in a shipwreck, and you saved them.

2. A factory is polluting your local body of water, and you’re looking for revenge.

3. You played a prank on the other PCs while they were swimming; after a good laugh, they invited you to join them.

4. You’ve been sent to search for a rare plant, believed by many to be extinct.


**Nix Advancement:**

Calm Stranger

Enhanced Speed

Restful Presence

Ruin Lore

Soothe the Savage

Wilderness Life


#### Sylph

You’re an air spirit, with the gift of wingless flight and hawklike eyes. You’re happiest when you have an aerial view; you lean more toward strategy than action, calling the shots from an unmatched vantage point. Your sensitivity to air currents and atmospheric pressure means you’re able to predict weather patterns, which you incorporate into your machinations.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Master Plans:** +2 to your Intellect or Speed Pool.

**Sylph Flight (2 Intellect or Speed points):** You can fly a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action, for up to ten minutes total. Enabler.

Top-Down Strategy: You’re skilled in logistics and planning.

**Sharp Vision:** You’re trained in visual perception.

**Oncoming Storm (1 Intellect point):** You can predict weather patterns (approaching storm systems, cloud cover, wind direction) for the next twelve hours. Action.

**Fragile:** Might defense tasks are hindered.


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. You saw the other PCs headed toward danger and called out a warning before the situation turned sour.

2. You got in trouble for flying in restricted airspace, and the other PCs helped cover for you.

3. You need help with a spell that will enable you to communicate with birds of prey.

4. You helped the other PCs recover a kite that became tangled in tree branches and power lines.


**Sylph Advancement:**

Enhanced Intellect

Enhanced Speed

Eyes Adjusted

Influence Swarm

Precision

Shock


#### Unmagical

You’re not good at using magic. In fact, it’s clear that you’re inherently unmagical—magic is as confusing, difficult, and awkward for you as learning lava spells would be for a frost giant. It’s not that you don’t believe in magic (though maybe you don’t) or that you don’t like magic (though maybe you don’t). It’s just that you and magic are incompatible. You’ve learned to compensate for this problem and even turn it into an advantage in some cases.

An Unmagical character shouldn’t be able to overcome their inability by becoming trained in magic. The GM might allow them to train away part of the inability with training in specific skills, such as “Onslaught” or “magical weapons.”

Playing an Adept or Speaker character with the Unmagical descriptor is a challenge, as their abilities mostly stem from supernatural power and therefore all of them would be hindered. This descriptor is mainly for Warriors and Explorers who want to play up their not inherently magical nature.

You gain the following characteristics.

**Make Do With the Mundane:** +1 to each of your Pools.

**Resistant to Magic:** You are trained in all defense rolls against magic, spells, and magical effects.

**Inability:** All actions using magic (including casting spells and using magic objects) are hindered.

**Magical Failure:** Your unmagical nature means magic goes awry more often. For any task relating to or interacting with magic, you trigger a GM intrusion on a d20 roll of 1 or 2.


**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.**

1. One of the other PCs initially diagnosed you as unmagical, which made a lot of your life suddenly make sense.

2. You think this group of PCs might be on track to figuring out why some people are unmagical and perhaps “fixing” them.

3. You and the other PCs have the same rival or foe—someone who once tried using magic on you and failed spectacularly.

4. You volunteered because you knew your inherent resistance to magic would be useful to the group.


### Foci

This section presents new foci that can be used as-is in most modern fantasy campaigns. Each of them has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for other genres). The GM and player should adjust these details to suit the specific campaign they’ll be playing.


#### Codes Magic Apps

You are a maker, a crafter, but you use a unique combination of code and magic instead of wood, steel, or circuit boards. Like anyone who’s spent a lot of time working on a computer, you’ve learned some strange secrets, not all of them entirely legal, and you know a lot about games, people, and how things work. More than just a computer nerd, you’re a developer and (although you might not admit it) a hacker. Most of your specialized gear is hardware or software for your computer or smart device, so you can dress however you want. You’re probably used to wearing comfortable clothes, sitting for hours at a time, and enjoying many caffeinated beverages (that have permanently discolored some of your clothing).


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. You once created a magical app to help get them out of a sticky situation (parking ticket, failing grade, clingy relationship, and so on).

2. Pick one other PC. You know they know an embarrassing or incriminating secret about you.

3. Pick one other PC. Something about this person annoys or distracts you so that when they’re within immediate range, your tasks with computers and magical lore are hindered.

4. Pick one other PC. Every now and then, you’re able to copy a magical app cypher and send it to them (effectively creating a duplicate of one of yours).

**Additional Equipment:** Computer (laptop or desktop) and a smartphone or tablet.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Your next use of a magical app cypher within the next hour is eased.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** Your next use of a magical app cypher within the next day is eased.


##### Tier 1:

**Magical Programmer:** You are trained in crafting magical apps and in using (and exploiting) computer software. You know one or more computer languages well enough to write basic programs, and you are fluent in internet protocol. Enabler.


##### Tier 2:

**App Tinkerer:** If you spend at least one day tinkering with a magical app in your possession, it functions at one level higher than normal. This applies to all magical apps in your possession, but they retain this bonus only for you. Enabler.

Connected


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Confidence Artist or Master Magical Programmer as your tier 3 ability.

Confidence Artist

**Master Magical Programmer:** You are specialized in crafting magical apps and in using (and exploiting) computer software. Enabler.


##### Tier 4:

**Magical App Hacker:** All magical app cyphers you use function at one level higher than normal. If given a week, you can tinker with one of your magical app cyphers, transforming it into another magical app cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical—for example, a magical app that creates a fiery explosion probably can’t be turned into a healing app. Enabler.


##### Tier 5:

Knowing the Unknown


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Call in Favor or Usurp Cypher as your tier 6 ability.

Call in Favor

Usurp Cypher


#### Conjures Bullets

You blend sorcery and firearms into an amazing mix of magic and technology. Bullets and spells are almost interchangeable to you; your magic has a firearm motif and you cast using your gun. You might be a trick-shot sorcerer, a magical member of the armed forces, or an outlaw with a flair for arcane power. Gun nuts and wizard purists might look down on your blended technique, but you can do things that nobody else can do. You might call yourself a guncaster, spellshooter, or triggermage. You wear clothing that leaves your arms and hands free to use your weapon and cast spells, preferring something more flashy than a gunslinger’s long coat and more intimidating than typical magician or witch clothing.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. You once grazed this character with one of your spell bullets; it’s up to them whether they’ve forgiven you or still resent you for it.

2. Pick one other PC. You’ve accidentally discovered that you can shoot their spells out of your gun just like you do with your own spells, but the PC must be touchingyour gun while you fire it.

3. Pick one other PC. Based on your interactions, you think this character resents your use of guns, magic, or both.

4. Pick one other PC. This character can barely hear your gunshots (magical or otherwise), which are no louder than a whisper to them.

**Additional Equipment:** Medium or heavy handgun.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** The attack hits the side of the foe’s head, deafening them for a few minutes.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** The foe’s major blood vessel is hit, causing them to bleed 1 point of damage each round until someone succeeds at a difficulty 3 Intellect or Speed task to bind the wound.


##### Tier 1:

Practiced With Guns

**Spell Bullet:** In your hands, a typical handgun or rifle never needs to be loaded because you can automatically conjure a standard bullet for it as part of your attack action with that weapon.

Alternatively, instead of casting a spell in the normal manner, you can channel it through your handgun, firing it like a bullet. This is as loud as firing a normal bullet and uses the handgun’s range (typically long) if that is longer than the spell’s normal range. If the spell is an attack spell, instead of making an Intellect-based attack you make a Speed-based attack; assets and skill with guns apply to the attack, and you use your Speed Pool if you apply Effort to ease the attack. This means you use Intellect to cast the spell (and for applying Effort for additional effects or extra damage) and Speed for the attack roll (using Intellect Edge and Speed Edge for their respective Pools). Enabler.

You can use Spell Bullet to cast a spell that affects multiple targets. This might look like you’re firing multiple times or the one shot is passing through or ricocheting off each target.


##### Tier 2:

**Gun Jammer (2+ Intellect points):** You can interfere with a firearm so the next time it is used, it jams or misfires. The weapon must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Make an Intellect-based attack against the weapon or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you succeed, the next attack with the firearm fails, and the weapon won’t fire until someone uses an action to correct the problem. If you activate this ability when it isn’t your turn, your attack against the weapon is hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more firearms; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action or enabler.


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Iron Eye or Trained Guncasting as your tier 3 ability.

**Iron Eye:** You inflict an additional 3 points of damage with any single-target attack spell cast through a firearm using Spell Bullet. If the attack spell doesn’t inflict damage, you instead can modify the spell as if you had applied a level of Intellect Effort to it. Enabler.

**Trained Guncasting:** You are trained in using guns (whether firing normal bullets or Spell Bullets). Enabler.


##### Tier 4:

**Hasty Guncasting:** You can make two gun attacks as a single action; one is a spell (using Spell Bullet) and the other is a normal gunshot. You can make these attacks in either order, but the second one is hindered by two steps. Enabler.


##### Tier 5:

**Bullet Jaunt (5 Intellect points):** Every Spell Bullet you fire leaves a faint path of magic that you can see and follow. Choose the path of one Spell Bullet within long range that you fired in the past minute; you instantly teleport to any place you want along its path. Alternatively, you can use Spell Bullet to conjure a standard bullet, fire it at a target within gun range, and jaunt as part of the action of firing the bullet. Action to teleport along an existing path or to fire a bullet and teleport along its path.


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Deadeye or Special Shot as your tier 6 ability.

**Deadeye:** You inflict an additional 6 points of damage with any single-target attack spell cast through a firearm using Spell Bullet. If the attack spell doesn’t inflict damage, you instead can modify the spell as if you had applied two levels of Intellect Effort to it. If you have the Iron Eye ability, you can exchange it for Trained Guncasting. Enabler.

Special Shot


#### Hunts Witches

You know enough about magic to mistrust anyone who uses it, especially witches—people who study ancient rituals, make pacts with evil creatures, and use their power for personal gain. Warped by their abilities, they are dangerous threats to regular folks, and it’s up to people like you to find and eliminate those threats. Sure, some witches claim to be good and even act friendly, but you’ve seen it go bad all too often, and you won’t be fooled again. You always carry weapons for fighting witches, or at least know what common tools will do as a weapon in a pinch. You wear clothing appropriate to the region and era (especially if regular people don’t know about magic or witches and you have to hide what you do). You may have a token, icon, or other reminder of your purpose, such as a lucky coin, a holy book, or a pouch of magic-thwarting herbs given to you by your mentor.

What a “witch” is depends on the setting. In a setting where magic is rare or secret, superstitious people might consider anyone who uses magic to be a dangerous witch. In a different setting, “witch” might refer to a specific organization of people who know how to use magic.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. You are friends, and you’d hate to see anything bad happen to them.

2. Pick one other PC. You know that some mysterious quality about them makes witches tend to choose them as targets over other people.

3. Pick one other PC. You know they’ve had a run-in with a witch before, and you want to hear how that played out.

4. Pick one other PC. You’ve known this person quite a while, and in fact it was a witch attack against them that convinced you to start hunting witches.

**Additional Equipment:** A book of lore about witches, passed down to you from past witch hunters and updated over the years (or decades or centuries) with their advice and discoveries about witches.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You intimidate your foe so much that they pause, taking no action on their next turn (but they’re still able to defend themselves).

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You are so intimidating that your foe chooses to flee, or at least retreat a bit to recover its courage and think of a new strategy.


##### Tier 1:

**Witch Bane:** You inflict 1 additional point of damage with weapons. When you inflict damage to witches (or other intelligent creatures who cast spells), you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

**Witch Lore:** You are trained in the traditional names, habits, suspected lairs, and related topics regarding the witches of your world. You know enough of at least one quasi-magical language (such as Latin or Ancient Greek) that you can make yourself understood to them. Enabler.


##### Tier 2:

Will of Legend


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Improved Witch Bane or Misdirect as your tier 3 ability.

**Improved Witch Bane:** When you inflict damage to witches (or other intelligent creatures who cast spells), you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Misdirect


##### Tier 4:

**Countercharm (5 Intellect points):** If you are affected by an unwanted ongoing magical condition or affliction (such as a curse, paralysis spell, withering hex, and so on) that gives you additional rolls to end it early, your rolls to end it early are eased by two steps until you break free. Enabler.


##### Tier 5:

Greater Skill with Attacks


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Hard to Kill or Heroic Witch Bane as your tier 6 ability.

Hard to Kill

**Heroic Witch Bane:** When you inflict damage to witches (or other intelligent creatures who cast spells), you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.


#### Inks Spells on Skin

Your enchanted heritage is etched upon you. Studying strange formulas, mystic runes, and magical glyphs to learn spells is one thing. Making spells truly a part of you is another, but that’s exactly what you do when you apply magical inks to create intricate spell tattoos across your body. Each tattoo you inscribe on yourself is not merely a design, but the keystone of a spell, giving you the ability to cast it. Because your tattoos are magical, you can continually add to those you’ve already accumulated without ruining the designs, allowing your mastery over magic to grow. You often wear clothing that bares your arms and perhaps other parts of your body to expose your tattoos, so that others know you for a spellcaster.

**Readying Spell Tattoos:** You learn two abilities (spells) at every tier of this focus, and each of them becomes a tattoo on your body. However, for each tier’s spells, you can only have one of the two readied (available for casting) at any given time, and the other is merely an interesting design until you change your readied spell for that tier. To change one readied spell, immediately after using a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll, you must spend one minute in meditation, after which you can swap one readied spell.

The Inks Spells on Skin focus works similarly to the Masters Spells focus. The GM may consider allowing characters with either of these foci to choose abilities from either focus when they advance to a new tier.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. They once broke a bottle of one of your magical tattoo inks. It’s up to you if you’ve forgiven them or not.

2. Pick one other PC. You think they could learn your tattoo magic, and you’d like to teach them. They may or may not be interested in learning it.

3. Pick one other PC. Whenever you ready your spells for the day, this character feels faint pain on their body where your corresponding tattoo is.

4. Pick one other PC. This character asked you to give them a tattoo, so you did. Somehow, now you can always sense their general direction and distance from you.

**Additional Equipment:** Special ink, a tattooing needle, and a clay, stone, or wooden tablet marked with strange glyphs.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Exposed skin on the target creature is marked with a glowing glyph of your choice for one hour.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** The foe is cursed, hindering all their actions for one minute.


##### Tier 1:

Fleet of Foot

**Poison Touch (2 Intellect points):** You touch a creature and lines of poison crawl through their skin. They take 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are hindered on their next turn. Action.


##### Tier 2:

**Eclipse (2 Intellect points):** You drain the light from an immediate area within long range. Bright light (like a sunny day outdoors) becomes dim light, normal light (like inside a well-lit room) becomes very dim light, and anything darker becomes darkness. If you cast this spell on an object, the darkness moves with the object, and can be suppressed if it is enclosed in a light-proof container or wrapping. Action.

**Mist Form (4 Intellect points):** You change into a cloud of mist for up to ten minutes, filling an immediate area. You gain an asset to sneaking tasks and Speed defense tasks, but you lose the benefit of any armor you wear. You can pass through any barrier that allows air to move through it (such as a fence, wire screen, cloth, or pipe), moving up to an immediate distance each round. You can’t affect or be affected by normal matter, but energy attacks (like fire or explosions) and mental attacks still affect you. You cannot speak but can still use abilities that don’t rely on human speech or affecting physical matter (other than yourself). If large portions of the mist are separated (such as behind a closed door) when you return to human form, you move one step down the damage track. Action to change or revert.


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose any two of the following as your tier 3 ability: Command, Lightning Flash, or Outwit.

Command

**Lightning Flash (4+ Intellect points):** Lightning strikes within long range, filling an immediate area and inflicting 3 points of damage on all affected creatures. Effort applied to one attack counts for all attacks against targets in the area of the flash. Even on an unsuccessful attack, a creature in the area still takes 1 point of damage. Your attack is eased against targets wearing, carrying, or made of a significant amount of metal. Action.

Outwit


##### Tier 4:

Elemental Protection

**Incapacitate (4 Intellect points):** You use necromantic magic to make one creature in short range fall prone and be unable to take actions for one round. Action.


##### Tier 5:

Bypass Barrier

Granite Wall


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose any two of the following as your tier 6 ability: Divide Your Mind, Petrify, or Summon Demon.

Divide Your Mind

**Petrify (6+ Intellect points):** You slowly transform a creature within short range into lifeless stone. The target must be level 2 or lower. If your attack succeeds, the creature takes 6 points of damage and moves one step down the damage track as their flesh begins to mineralize. If the transformation is not interrupted by the end of your next turn, the creature fully becomes a harmless stone statue. You can cast this spell to restore a petrified target back into their living self. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to petrify a level 6 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort. Action.

Summon Demon


#### Is A Car Wizard

Your skill behind the wheel is legendary, combining natural talent and specialized magic to perform stunts and tricks that are impossible for regular people. Nothing beats the feel of wind in your hair, except maybe the intense purr of a finely tuned engine augmented by sorcery. You love pushing yourself (and your vehicle) to the limit, even if it’s dangerous—better to die a legend than live a long, dull life driving something boring. You enjoy drawing attention to yourself, so you tend to wear sleek clothing, stylish sunglasses, and borderline-gaudy jewelry, but never anything that interferes with your ability to control a car or cast a spell.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. To repay a favor they did for you a while ago, you promised to drive them somewhere. They haven’t taken you up on it yet.

2. Pick one other PC. You were the getaway driver for them once in the past— perhaps for something criminal, a car stunt for a viral video, or to avoid a bad situation.

3. Pick one other PC. You know they were once in a very bad car collision that left the vehicle a wreck, but they somehow weren’t hurt at all.

4. Pick one other PC. They used to associate with someone who was trying to hunt you down, but they haven’t been in contact with that person in a while.

**Additional Equipment:** A reasonably fast car.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** The foe you hit (with your spell or car) is moved horizontally an immediate distance in a direction of your choice.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** The foe is knocked prone and loses their next action.


##### Tier 1:

Driver


##### Tier 2:

**One Hand on the Wheel:** As an action, you can cast a one-action spell and attempt a driving task. Enabler.

**Car Magic (3+ Intellect points):** You can alter a magical ability you cast so it also affects the vehicle you’re driving, as if it were a part of you. For example, if you’re driving and you cast Hover on yourself, you and the car begin to float; if you cast Invisibility on yourself, you and the car turn invisible. Spells cast on a car this way tend to last only a few rounds before expiring (although the spell still lasts its full duration on you). The cost of Car Magic is added to the cost of the spell you’re casting. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect other creatures within the car; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to two additional creatures in the car. Enabler.

The main reason to cast Hover on a moving car is to make awesome-looking jumps that would be impossible without ramps, magic, or Hollywood special effects.


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Expert Driver or Perfect Parking Space as your tier 3 ability.

Expert Driver

1Perfect Parking Space (3 Intellect points):

You can send your car into a pocket dimension that moves with you and is just large enough to hold it. Nobody other than you can perceive or access this space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to store the car if you and the car have more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the car while it’s in the space harms you, and so on. Storing or retrieving the car happens over one minute as it slowly (and visibly) vanishes or reappears; you can reduce this time to just one round if you succeed at a level 4 Intellect task. Action to initiate.


##### Tier 4:

Enhanced Intellect


##### Tier 5:

**Deer in the Headlights:** When you cast an attack spell while driving, you can modify the spell as if you had applied two levels of Intellect Effort to it. Enabler.


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Spells Have No Speed Limit or Trick Driver as your tier 6 ability.

**Spells Have No Speed Limit:** Any car you have driven for at least a minute responds to you like a well-trained robot, allowing you to mentally give it orders from a long distance away. This control

includes any aspect of driving the car (such as steering, accelerating, and braking) and any moveable parts on the car (such as opening or closing the doors, hood, or trunk). The car takes actions on your turn, and you make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. You can only control one car at a time with this ability (although you could manually drive one car and magically

control another car at the same time). If you are driving the car you’re controlling with this ability, your driving tasks and extreme tricks with the car (such as jumping a ravine or other vehicle, spinning in the air, landing safely on another vehicle, and so on) are eased. Enabler.

Trick Driver


#### Learned From the Classics

Magic comes intuitively to some people, but you’ve always had to work a bit harder. Luckily, you find that research comes naturally. You know what questions to ask; you know which books, websites, or professionals will have the answers. You spent years studying and practicing, and you taught yourself everything you know. Now you’re a skilled magician who’s always eager to learn more—evidenced by your lengthy reading list.


**Connection: Choose one of the following or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.**

1. Pick one other PC. They appreciate (but do not necessarily share) your obsession with books, libraries, and research.

2. Pick one other PC. You once owed this character a lot of money (or vice versa), although that debt is now paid.

3. Pick one other PC. They remind you about an obscure author whose books you enjoy, and you can’t help but like them.

4. Pick one other PC. You think this person is woefully ignorant about a lot of important topics (history, magic, ethics, and so on).

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You gain a burst of insight, easing your next action by one step.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** Your knowledge lets you tap into an obscure current of magic and make a free recovery roll as part of your current action.


##### Tier 1:

Enhanced Intellect

**Library Life:** When a problem needs solving, you may not know the solution, but you know where to look. You are trained in research. Enabler.


##### Tier 2:

Flex Skill


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Enhanced Intellect Edge or Repeated Rituals as your tier 3 ability.

Enhanced Intellect Edge

**Repeated Rituals:** If you’ve successfully completed a ritual in the past, tasks for performing that ritual again are eased by two steps. Enabler


##### Tier 4:

Knowing the Unknown


##### Tier 5:

Mind of a Leader


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Greater Enhanced Intellect or Mental Magic as your tier 6 ability.

Greater Enhanced Intellect

**Mental Magic:** When attempting a magic-based Might or Speed task, you can instead roll as if it were an Intellect action. This means that if you apply Effort, you spend points from your Intellect Pool and use your Intellect Edge. Enabler.


#### Practices Moon Magic

The moon is a powerful force on the world, in terms of both science and magic. She hangs overhead like a watchful eye, makes creatures act strangely, represents cycles of time, and causes the ebb and flow of the tides. To you, she is a friend, an inspiration, and a constant reminder that someone is watching over you. You wield her magic to create beams of dangerous light, influence others, travel, and sense the underlying truth and reality of things. The day is not your foe (after all, the moon is often visible during the day), but you prefer the night when the moon can be the brightest light in the sky. You might call yourself a moonchild or a moon witch. You probably prefer black, white, or grey clothing, with flowing portions such as long sleeves, a cape, or a long coat. You might have one or more tattoos or tokens representing the moon, either full, crescent, or in multiple phases. Your favorite jewelry and adornments (like buttons) usually have moonstones.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. You can harmlessly bounce your moon spells off them, increasing your range by a short distance and even allowing you to shoot around corners.

2. Pick one other PC. You know they think your obsession with the moon is weird, pointless, or superstitious, and you feel the need to prove them wrong.

3. Pick one other PC. Sometimes you can’t detect them with any of your senses or affect them with your magic, even when they’re right in front of you.

4. Pick one other PC. Your power and theirs have an unusual connection; instead of using your one-action recovery roll on yourself, you can use it on them (and vice versa).

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Your foe is dazzled by a burst of moonlight, hindering them for one round.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** A surge of lunar power knocks your foe prone and disarms them of an object they’re holding, which lands an immediate distance away.


##### Tier 1:

**Moonbeam (1+ Intellect point):** You emit a cone of pale, cool moonlight from your hand, illuminating up to a short distance with dim light, lasting for one minute. As your action or as part of the action of activating this ability, you can tighten the beam so it focuses on one creature, inflicting either 4 points of cold damage or 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor), which immediately ends the spell. You automatically know if the struck creature is a shapechanger (such as a werewolf), although this doesn’t tell you what kind of shapechanger they are or what their true form is. Action.


##### Tier 2:

Eyes Adjusted

Inspire Aggression


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Nightstrike or Spur Effort as your tier 3 ability. Whichever one you choose, you also gain Moon Adaptation.

Nightstrike

Spur Effort

**Moon Adaptation:** You can survive indefinitely in a vacuum environment (such as the moon or space).

Although Moon Adaptation protects you from the airless environment of the moon, people traveling with you aren’t so lucky—unless you teleport directly to a pressurized location such as a moon base or an abandoned NASA vehicle.


##### Tier 4:

**Moonlight Barrage (4+ Intellect points):** You call down dozens of rays of moonlight into an adjacent short area. All within the area take 4 points of damage from mystical cold and glow with faint moonlight equivalent to a candle for one minute (a creature can end this glow early as an action or by entering an area that moonlight cannot penetrate, such as a deep cave or a room with no windows). You automatically know if any creature in the area is a shapechanger (such as a

werewolf), although this doesn’t tell you what kind of shapechanger they are or what their true form is. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.


##### Tier 5:

**Moon Portal (6+ Intellect points):** You instantaneously transmit yourself to any location on Earth, as long as moonlight is shining on you and on the spot you want to be. Alternatively, you can instantaneously transport yourself from Earth to the moon or back again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action.


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Precognition or True Senses as your tier 6 ability.

Precognition

True Senses


#### Steers The Coven

Magic is strongest when wielded by a community. The strength of a community is derived from the strength of its leader, and you’ve taken on the role. Maybe you were chosen, or maybe you volunteered. Maybe you have an official title and responsibilities, or maybe you serve as an informal mentor. Maybe you run a coven with bylaws and a charter, or maybe you host gatherings where your friends and family can perform rituals together. Regardless, you’re responsible for a coalition of magicians who look to you for guidance, protection, and problem-solving.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. You have a friendly rivalry with this person, perhaps due to philosophical differences or belonging to another coven with contrary goals.

2. Pick one other PC. You want to learn more about this person so you can decide if they should join your coven or are somehow a threat to it.

3. Pick one other PC. Long ago you were very close to this character, but you drifted apart. You’ll need to decide if you’re starting anew or trying to rekindle the old friendship.

4. Pick one other PC. This character or someone they care about is in your coven, and you feel responsible for protecting them.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** The evident power of the support from your coven intimidates a foe, who retreats a short distance away on their next turn.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** Your opponent respects your commitment to your coven so much that they withdraw from the conflict (although they may return later).


##### Tier 1:

Community Activist

Community Knowledge


##### Tier 2:

Shepherd’s Fury


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Inspire Action or True Guardian as your tier 3 ability.

Inspire Action

True Guardian


##### Tier 4:

**Ritual Guidance:** When you participate in a magical ritual with two or more members of your coven, ritual tasks for all participants are eased by two steps. Enabler


##### Tier 5:

Protective Instincts (6+ Might, Speed, or Intellect points): When engaging in combat to defend your coven or home, you can attack up to five different foes with a single action as long as they are within immediate range of each other. All the attacks must be the same sort of attack (melee, ranged, or spell), and the point cost of this ability is deducted from whichever Pool the attack uses. Pay the costs (if any) separately for each attack, and make a separate attack roll for each foe. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all attacks. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply to one action. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the number of foes you can attack, with one additional foe per level of Effort. Enabler.


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Deep Consideration or Drawing on Life’s Experiences as your tier 6 ability.

Deep Consideration

Drawing on Life’s Experiences


#### Transmits Energy

**Magic is often compared to electromagnetism:** it’s an invisible and ubiquitous force that holds everything together. Magic runs through every living creature, the ground, and even the air around us. You can sense—and influence—the flow of power, the way some people can hear currents running through wire. In a crisis, you attack by draining a foe’s energy. Otherwise, you focus on helping others by catalyzing and enhancing their magic abilities.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. This character thinks you’re some sort of energy vampire, either dangerous or just annoying.

2. Pick one other PC. You believe they have insight about how to master your magic, if you can just convince them to trust you with their secrets.

3. Pick one other PC. You once knocked out this character with your power, but were able to jolt them back awake again. At the time they seemed to think it was funny.

4. Pick one other PC. You once recharged one of their powerful cyphers, although you’re not sure how you managed it.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You gently drain 2 points of energy from your foe, which you can divide between your Might and Speed Pools.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You gently drain 5 points of energy from your foe, which you can divide between your Might and Speed Pools.


##### Tier 1:

**Lend a Hand:** If an ally attempts a magical task and fails, they can try again without spending Effort if you help them. You provide this advantage to your friend even if you are not trained in the task that they’re retrying. Enabler.


##### Tier 2:

Drain Creature


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Buddy System or Tap Currents as your tier 3 ability.

Buddy System

**Tap Currents:** You can draw energy from the earth itself into your body. If you concentrate and don’t move from where you’re standing for one minute, you restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve made a ten-hour recovery roll. If you have the Store Energy ability, you can instead use Tap Currents to add 3 points to your Siphon Pool. (This use of this ability is not limited to one use per ten-hour recovery roll.) Action to initiate.


##### Tier 4:

Store Energy


##### Tier 5:

Share the Power


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Explosive Release or both Continuous Transfer and Drain at a Distance at tier 6.

Explosive Release

**Continuous Transfer:** When you use either Drain Creature or Tap Currents to drain energy, you can transfer it to another creature within short range, restoring points to their Might or Speed Pools (or health for an NPC). This occurs seamlessly, as part of the same action. Enabler.

Drain at a Distance


#### Turns Decay to Growth

**You’re comfortable with decomposition:** the bacteria and fungi that break down organic material are living creatures, and you coax magic from the interplay of life and death. To you, rot isn’t cause for revulsion—it’s an opportunity to build something new. Maggots, mushrooms, and mold are actors in your process, not unlike familiars. You probably keep a garden, nourished by your meticulously maintained compost pile. Your community might express discomfort with your methods, leading to friction. If you react to criticism by isolating yourself, you won’t be lonely for very long—what you have to offer is vital and rare, and it’s inevitable that someone will ask you for help.


**Connection:**

1. Pick one other PC. This character dislikes the smell that your spells make and tries to be at least an immediate distance away when you cast them.

2. Pick one other PC. This character is fascinated by your powers and wants to make use of them (or just thinks you can provide them with medicinal mushrooms).

3. Pick one other PC. This character believes you are a member of a mushroom cult (which to them might be a good, bad, or neutral thing).

4. Pick one other PC. You and this character have a magical connection, and you each add +1 to your recovery rolls when within a short distance of each other.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Your foe is dazed (hindered) for the next round.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** Your foe is stunned for one round, or you restore 2 points to any one of your Pools.


##### Tier 1:

Wilderness Lore

**Spore Cloud (1 Intellect point):** You throw a handful of mushrooms that speed toward a target within long range. The attack inflicts 3 points of damage and envelops the target in a haze of toxic spores, which inflicts 1 additional point of damage per round (ignores Armor) for the next minute or until the target uses an action to wash the spores away. Action.


##### Tier 2:

Wilderness Explorer


##### Tier 3:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Reading Decomposition or both Grasping Foliage and Necromancy at tier 3.

**Reading Decomposition (3 Intellect points):** You gain knowledge about an area by reading energy released by decomposition and decay. You can ask the GM a single, matter-of-fact question about the location and get an answer if you succeed on the Intellect roll. “What was the last ritual performed in this room?” is a good example of a simple question. “Why was this room used for a ritual?” is not an appropriate question, because it has more to do with the mindset of whoever performed the ritual than with qualities of the room. Simple questions usually have a difficulty of 2, but technical questions or those that involve facts meant to be kept secret can have a much higher difficulty. Action.

Unless an environment is absolutely sterilized, there are enough microbes, fungal spores, and other organic debris in an area to allow you to use Reading Decomposition.

Grasping Foliage

Necromancy


##### Tier 4:

If you have Necromancy, your tier 4 ability is Greater Necromancy. If you have Reading Decomposition, your tier 4 ability is Rewind Rot.

Greater Necromancy

**Rewind Rot:** Your grasp on life and death energy means that you can heal—even from death—as long as your head, heart, and hands remain intact. One minute after descending a step on the damage track, you regain 2 Pool points. However, if you return from death, it is with a permanent 2-point reduction in your Intellect Pool. Enabler.


##### Tier 5:

Insect Eruption


##### Tier 6:

**Ability Choice:** Choose either Restore Life or Word of Death as your tier 6 ability.

Restore Life

Word of Death


## New Abilities

**Access the Broadcast (2+ Intellect points):** You create a flat rectangular illusory “screen” within immediate range that can display any broadcast television signal in your area (similar to using a television with an antenna) or any video streams in the area (similar to tapping into a wireless network). The screen is anywhere from 1 to 3 feet (30 cm to 1 m) across, includes stereo sound, and lasts for one hour. As an action, you can change the channel, the volume, or both. The effect ends if you are more than a short distance away from the screen. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the width of the screen by up to 3 feet (1 m). Action.

Wireless networks hosting video streams are usually locked or encrypted, which requires you to succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the network’s level (typically level 4) to watch them.

**Background Music (1+ Intellect points):** You create quiet background music in a short area, loud enough to be heard in a room with normal conversation, but not so loud to be distracting or overwhelming. The music repeats through up to ten songs you know, lasting up to an hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort adds one hour to the play time and five songs to the playlist. Action.

**Blackout (3 Intellect points):** You issue a disruptive ripple of energy within short range, creating an area where the electrical power grid fails. All devices relying on being plugged into the grid stop working. Battery‑powered devices still work. Any standby generator connected in this area functions normally, activating emergency power within a few rounds. The blackout otherwise lasts for one minute. Action.

**Blood Magician:** When you wish it, you can use points from your Might Pool rather than your Intellect Pool to activate a magical ability (including applying Effort to that ability). If you use your Might Pool this way, you use your Might Edge instead of your Intellect Edge. Enabler.

**Bound Magic Familiar:** You have a magic familiar bound to you through a magical mark on your body (a tattoo, rune, scar, or something as mundane as a freckle or mole). Normally, the familiar remains sleeping in its spiritual form. When you use an action to manifest them, they appear next to you as a creature with a specific form (such as a cat, hawk, homunculus, tiny dragon, or other suitable magical creature) and can communicate with you telepathically. The familiar is friendly toward you but has its own personality determined by the GM. The familiar can remain physically manifested for up to one hour, after which they return to their sleeping spiritual form and cannot manifest again until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. While manifested, they accompany you and follow your instructions. The familiar must remain within an immediate distance of you; if they move farther away, they are yanked back into their magical mark at the end of your following turn and cannot return until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. The familiar doesn’t make attacks, but they can use their action to grant you an asset for any one attack you make on your turn. Otherwise, they can take actions on their own (though you’ll likely roll for them). If the familiar is reduced to 0 health, they dissipate into their spiritual form and cannot manifest again until 1d6 + 2 days have passed. Action to manifest the familiar.

**Magic familiar:** level 3, Speed defense as level 5 due to size, one knowledge skill as level 4

**Critter Telekinesis (1 Intellect point):** You. telekinetically move a small creature (no larger than a medium dog) an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the creature, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The creature safely arrives at your chosen location without any residual force. If the creature knows you and you have a free hand, you can automatically grab the creature as part of the action of using this ability. This ability lacks the fine control to move anything with much speed, so in most situations, it’s used to reposition an animal (such as a pet) out of a dangerous or inconvenient location. For example, you could safely pull a scared cat out from under a bed, retrieve a puppy from a storm drain, or relocate a wild bird that got inside your house. Action.

**Facsimile of Life (3 Intellect points):** You give an object limited mobility, awareness, and intellect, allowing it to move about as if it were a small pet. The object must be within immediate distance and no larger than half your size. When animated, the object can perform tasks for you as if it were a level 1 creature, but otherwise is treated as an object of its level (for example, it uses the object damage track instead of health). The animation lasts for an hour or until you and it are at least a long distance apart, at which time the object becomes inert again. Action.

**Ghost Car (4+ Intellect points):** You create a level 3 ghostly-looking car that can carry two people and a small amount of luggage. You or a creature you designate can drive the car as normal. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, it can carry two additional passengers and its level increases by 1. The car lasts for an hour, after which it vanishes. Action.

**Hush (1+ Intellect point):** You create a transparent bubble within short range that muffles very loud sounds within it, such as alarms, sirens, leaf blowers, and crying babies. The bubble is about 3 feet (1 m) across and any noise from within it comes out no louder than a normal speaking voice. The bubble lasts for one minute and moves with the target. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; one level of Effort increases the duration to ten minutes, two levels increases it to an hour, and three levels increases it to ten hours. Action.

**Magnification (1+ Intellect point):** You create a rectangular frame, visible only to you, that doubles the magnification of whatever you see through it. The frame defaults to hovering in front of your face about an arm’s length away, but you can use your action to move it up, down, or to either side. The frame lasts for ten minutes and grants an asset on perception tasks at range. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the magnification by another increment (×3 for one level of Effort, ×4 for two levels of Effort, and so on). Action.

**Network Dead Zone (3 Intellect points):** You interfere with radio signals, such as Bluetooth, wifi, cell phone service, AM/FM radio, ham radio, and walkie-talkies. Choose a short area within immediate range; all such transmissions into or out of that area are blocked due to a combination of interference and lack of reception. This lasts for one minute. Action.

Powerful radio sources, such as a radio station transmitter or a telecommunication satellite, may be able to punch through a Network Dead Zone spell.

**Paralyzing Touch (4+ Intellect points):** You gather necromantic energy in your fingertip and touch a creature. A target of level 3 or lower is paralyzed and helpless for an hour. Each level of Effort applied increases the level cap of the target by 1. Action.

**Remote Slap (3 Intellect points):** You use an active telephone, cellular, internet, or closed-circuit video connection to slap a creature. The target must be actively using a device making use of this connection, such as being on the other end of a phone call or text message, browsing the same social media website or app you’re using, or monitoring a closed-circuit camera that is recording you. Make an Intellect-based attack against the creature; success means the creature takes 1 point of damage, as if they had been telekinetically slapped in the face by the device they’re using. Each additional remote slap against that creature is hindered by an additional step (resetting after one hour). Action.

**Share Memory (3 Intellect points):** You share a memory of your choice with a willing creature you touch. The length of the shared memory can be no longer than about five minutes, but you can summarize longer memories (such as how you met, courted, and married your partner) with a “montage” that covers the most important details and underlying sentiment. The target experiences the memory as an instantaneous vision, and is aware that it is your memory rather than their own memory or experience. The memory is as vivid and accurate as you personally remember it. Action.

**Soul Familiar:** You have a soul familiar who accompanies you and follows your instructions. Your soul and their soul are interconnected (or the familiar might actually be a physical manifestation of your soul). The familiar loves and cares for you like the best combination of a pet and a close friend.

The familiar is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg); a typical soul familiar looks like a bird, cat, rat, lizard, snake, or toad, but more unusual forms (such as a tiny demon, dragon, elemental, fey creature, or floating skull) are also possible. You and the GM must work out the details of your familiar, and you’ll probably make rolls for them in combat or when they take actions. The familiar acts on your turn. Their movement is based on their creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on).

You and your familiar can communicate telepathically within long range, or empathically within very long range. Beyond this range, you can only sense each other’s general level of well-being.

Your familiar’s presence within short range counts as an asset for magical tasks that require at least one minute to activate or maintain.

If your familiar is within an immediate distance of you, you can roll any defense task for them, gaining the benefit of your skills, assets, and Effort (the familiar’s Speed defense tasks are eased by two steps due to their size). While within this distance, your familiar also gains the benefit of any ongoing spell you cast on yourself (for example, if you cast a spell on yourself that lets you breathe water, your familiar can breathe water).

Foes can use your soul familiar’s connection to you against you. If a foe is holding or restraining your familiar (or touching it while it is held or restrained by another creature or a device, such as manacles or a cage), the foe’s attacks and defenses against you are eased.

If an attack against your familiar would reduce their health to 0, you can magically intervene so their health is instead reduced to 1 and you move one step down the damage track. If your familiar dies, you move one step down the damage track. If you die, your familiar instantly dies.

You can replace a dead familiar (or revive them, if you have their remains) by performing a magical ritual that takes 1d6 days.

Enabler.

**Soul familiar:** level 2, Speed defense as level 4 due to size

A soul familiar with an animal form looks like a normal animal—there’s nothing obvious about them to indicate they’re anything other than what they appear to be.

**Statue Stasis (3 Intellect points):** You transform into a lifelike bronze or stone statue of yourself for a specific period of time (one minute, one hour, ten hours, or twenty-four hours). When in statue form, you are in stasis; you don’t age, can take no actions (other than making recovery rolls while you “sleep”), and gain +10 to Armor against all forms of damage, including damage not normally affected by Armor. If you take enough damage to get through your armor, the stasis effect immediately ends. Action.

## Modern Magic Creatures


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Bargainer Fiend <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Bargainer fiends are natives of “hell dimensions” whose job is to come to the mortal world and convince people to barter or trade their souls. Their natural shape is usually a lanky humanoid with horns, claws, vestigial bat wings, and a forked tail, with a faint smell of brimstone, but they can partially or completely disguise themselves as humans to tempt and advise mortals.

Typical devils are warriors and torturers, and demons are mortal souls reforged into entities of pure spite and hate, whereas bargainer fiends see themselves as classier beings with loftier goals. However, bargainers are aware that they are weaker than their counterparts, and they make sure they don’t do any front-line fighting if they can help it.

**Motive:** Bargain for souls

**Environment:** Anywhere humans can be found

**Health:** 9

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Deception as level 5

**Combat:** A bargainer fiend attacks with a punch or a firearm. If they aren’t trying to hide their inhuman nature, they throw short-range bolts of painful hellfire, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the target for one round.

The heart of a bargainer fiend’s power is its ability to arrange for rewards for a mortal client in exchange for the client’s soul. Typical rewards are training in a skill, learning a new type or focus ability, wealth equivalent to one exorbitant item, an artifact, or anything else that can be acquired by spending 4 XP. The price is always the client’s mortal soul, usually after a specific time period. Bigger demands by the client require the fiend to get approval from their superiors, and the price is higher, but usually still manageable.

A bargainer fiend can use an action to transform themself into a human or near-human form (such as a human with devil horns) or return to their natural form. They can assume the guise of a specific human (such as a person their client knows) only if that human is dead or has an agreement with a bargainer fiend.

**Interaction:** Bargainer fiends serve at the pleasure of their infernal masters, and they know their lives are forfeit if they ever fail. This colors their interactions with clients; they will say anything to accomplish their mission, and their only true loyalty is to the fiend who created and controls them.

**Use:** A motivational speaker offers to teach clients confidence and charm, with great results. An old sorcerer knows some rare magic for those willing to pay a steep price. A mysterious person has been seen visiting people in the terminal ward of various hospitals.

**Loot:** A bargainer fiend may have a cypher relating to their duties or as a gift or payment for a client, but most of their material riches are hell-crafted and not safe to carry for long.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Divinity Of The City <---> 8 (24) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Divinities of the city are a pantheon of modern-era demigods who have a strong connection to some aspect of urban life. They get their powers from their connection to a modern element that’s being worshipped. For example, the Divinity of Defacement gains power when someone creates graffiti or stares in wonder at a mural, while the Divinity of Urban Creatures grows stronger each time someone saves a turtle from a highway or shivers at coyotes’ calls. Divinities look mostly humanoid, but their appearance has some tie to their connection. The Divinity of Defacement might wear graffiti-themed clothing, the Divinity of Urban Creatures might have a bear’s head, and the Divinity of Architecture might have gargoyle wings.

**Motive:** Defense; protection; power

**Environment:** Urban landscapes

**Health:** 75

**Damage Inflicted:** 8 points

**Armor:** 4

**Movement:** Short; long when flying

**Combat:** Divinities attack a foe up to a long distance away with a spell related to their connection (sending a pack of rabid raccoons after a foe, lifting a highway, or having a mural attack). These attacks inflict 8 points of damage on a single target or, if the divinity chooses, the attack hits all targets within short range of the destination for 6 points of damage.

Most divinities have a close-range attack as well, such as turning into a coyote and attacking their target with tooth and claw or grabbing a painted weapon out of a wall mural.

Divinities also have a number of additional spells, including:

Animate: Turns any material into an animate level 4 creature. The creature has a mind and will of its own, and acts just as that type of creature would act if it were born instead of created.

Forever Space: Creates an endless length of alleys, roads, or bridges between itself and all characters it chooses within long range. Characters must succeed on a level 5 Intellect defense task to find an exit. While moving through the forever space, characters take 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) each round.

Heal: The divinity heals themself, a creature, or an object for 5 points of damage.

Illusion: Divinities can cast elaborate and convincing illusions over their domain, making the area seem more appealing, beautiful, or dangerous. Illusions cover up to a ten-block area and last for up to an hour. Seeing through one is a level 8 task.

**Interaction:** Divinities rarely care about humans unless they’re connected to their particular part of the urban landscape. Sometimes they can be persuaded or negotiated with, but not if the character has previously damaged or endangered the divinity’s connection—for example, a poacher of urban wildlife probably has no chance of interacting positively with a Divinity of Urban Creatures.

**Use:** A divinity is a powerful aggressive or defensive force, putting the PCs in a position where they must fight or negotiate to prevent death and destruction. In addition to situations where a divinity clashes with those who would exploit them, they may have information or unique magic (such as an unlocking spell) that the characters need to reach a goal.

**Loot:** Divinities rarely carry anything of interest to humans, but they might bequeath to allies a powerful artifact related to some aspect of their domain.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Elemental, Electricity <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Electricity elementals alternate between a feral-looking humanoid energy form and a near-spherical cloud of intensely glowing sparks. They spontaneously arise when supernatural events take place near high-voltage wires or electrical substations, and their high rate of speed often means they’ve traveled hundreds of miles before anyone realizes they appeared. Extremely mobile and curious, they inadvertently or deliberately cause harm wherever they go.

**Motive:** Explore and shock

**Environment:** Anywhere electricity can easily reach

**Health:** 24

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Short; very long with electrical conduction

**Modifications:** Attacks and Speed defense as level 5 due to quickness; stealth as level 2 due to buzzing noise

**Combat:** An electricity elemental strikes twice each round with a limb, or fires one bolt of electricity at a target within short range.

As its action, an elemental can heal itself for up to 4 points of health by draining power from a touched electrical machine, creature (such as a robot), manifest cypher, or artifact. A drained object moves one step down the object damage track. A drained robot takes 4 points of damage. A drained manifest cypher is fully consumed and useless. A drained artifact immediately checks for depletion (artifacts with a depletion of “—” are either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 for this purpose).

An electricity elemental can pass through conductive materials at full speed, ignoring obstacles and difficult terrain. An electricity elemental can power any electrical device that runs on household power, but it’s uncomfortable for them and they don’t like doing it.

**Interaction:** Electricity elementals are somewhat intelligent but perceive and think at much faster rates than humans, so they quickly become frustrated with “slow” communication. They can be summoned and controlled with magic, but there’s a 10% chance the elemental breaks free of the spell and attacks or flees.

**Use:** Power grid fluctuations throughout the city may be the result of a roving electricity elemental. Something exploded every car battery along a major street. Something noisy has taken over the eccentric inventor’s workshop.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gargoyle <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Gargoyles are stone beings of many shapes and sizes that often start their lives as inanimate decor. However, few stay that way forever. Most alternate between dormancy and animated life during the course of their long existence.

Although their original purpose was to guard places, they are excellent at guarding almost anything, including other living beings. They can become deeply attached to these places and people, and their loyalty also makes them solid friends, companions, and even familiars.

Gargoyles may look like frogs, bunnies, demons, dragons, or any other creature real or imagined. They often (but not always) have wings.

**Motive:** Guarding

**Environment:** Cities, especially on older buildings

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 3

**Movement:** Short; long while flying

**Modifications:** Seeing through deception, stealth, hiding, and sneaking as level 6

**Combat:** Most gargoyles don’t wish to fight and will do so only reluctantly or if something or someone they’re guarding is threatened. Their most basic attack is to throw or fly themselves fully at their foe, hitting the target with their entire body for 4 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor), but they may claw twice, inflicting 4 points of damage with each attack.

Gargoyles can see in darkness as if it were daylight.

Gargoyles have a number of additional combat options and other abilities at their disposal, including the following:

Awaken Friend: Awaken another gargoyle out of its inanimate state and ask it to help. This other gargoyle must be within short range, it acts on the same initiative as the asking gargoyle, and it can take actions starting the turn after it is awakened.

Bulwark: Grow to twice their size to prevent others from getting through a doorway or other opening. They are able to stretch out their wings, limbs, and even other body parts to fill the entirety of the space.While in this form they cannot move or attack, but they can return to their normal size as part of another action.

Take the Attack: Move up to a short distance on someone else’s turn to take an attack directed at the person, place, or object they’re guarding. Other than the distance traveled, this works like the taking the attack cooperative action. (Typically, the gargoyle relies on its Armor to absorb most of this damage.)

Water Spout: Open their mouth and emit a powerful short-distance stream of water that inflicts 4 points of damage to everyone in its path.

**Interaction:** While gargoyles can be conscripted and tricked into guarding, they’re much more likely to throw themselves into the job if someone takes the time to earn their loyalty. They are not always the smartest, but they are very “grumpy sunshine” and often quite funny.

**Use:** Gargoyles work best when used to defend something. PCs can end up at odds with a gargoyle who thinks (incorrectly or correctly) that their beloved building is in danger, or have to find a gargoyle that for some reason has gone missing from their customary perch.

Gargoyle Names: All gargoyles have a name, even those that may not have left their dormancy for the first time. However, few will tell someone their real name, as they have a healthy fear of that knowledge being used for ill. Instead, they offer up a nickname, usually something similar, at least until they learn to trust someone fully.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Haunted Car <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Whether you call them haunted, possessed, misenchanted, cursed, or just plain evil, some cars develop a hateful will, the ability to drive themselves, and a love for the smell of blood on asphalt.

A haunted car makes a bond with a chosen driver—usually someone with a similarly evil nature, or a meek person the car can influence and control. Over time, the driver might physically transform due to the car’s influence, becoming more attractive, confident, and cruel. The car is jealous of anyone interested in its chosen driver, either pushing the driver to turn them away or hunting them down on its own.

A haunted car has an empathic connection with its chosen driver, conveying simple emotions and desires when within short range. It otherwise is limited to whatever it can play on its radio, using snippets of songs (typically from the era it was made) as threats or taunts toward its next victims.

A haunted car lets itself be driven by its chosen driver, but it is capable of driving itself with great skill and can operate any moveable part of itself (doors, locks, trunk, and so on).

> Chosen driver: level 2, social interaction as level 1, driving and repairs as level 3
>
> A chosen driver trained or indoctrinated by a haunted car might develop abilities similar to the Drives Like a Maniac focus or, if they can use magic, the Is a Car Wizard focus.

**Motive:** Violence and vengeance

**Environment:** Anywhere cars can go

**Health:** 20

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Armor:** 2 or 3

**Movement:** Long (or faster outside of combat)

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to size; stealth as level 3 due to size and engine noise

**Combat:** A haunted car attacks by colliding with or running over a foe, inflicting 6 points of damage. If the car does nothing but move at least a short distance on its turn, its attack in the next round is eased and inflicts an additional 5 points of damage. If a foe is within it, the car moves its interior parts (seats, seat belts, and so on) to crush and choke them, tries to force them out with an open door and a hard turn, or (if all else fails) crashes in an attempt to eject the passenger through the windshield.

A haunted car can drive itself a long distance each round and still take another action (such as attacking). Most can reach an overland speed of up to 100 miles per hour (160 kph).

A haunted car with at least 1 health recovers a few points of health every hour. The chosen driver can double this rate by actively repairing the car.

**Interaction:** A haunted car doesn’t converse or bargain. It lurks, using engine noises and evocative songs from its radio to intimidate and threaten anyone it wants to kill.

**Use:** Haunted cars go looking for trouble or to hurt those who harmed them or their driver.

**Loot:** A haunted car created by magic might have a few strange bits that can be used as magical cyphers. Otherwise, it’s worth whatever cash a chop shop or junkyard will pay for it—assuming that won’t just spread its malice to other vehicles . . .


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hell Mary <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Say her name thirteen times, but only if you dare. Over the ages, Hell Mary has been rumored to be a ghost, a witch, a demon, and a hoax, and perhaps she has been all of these over time. But now she is none of these and more—over the years of worship and wonder and whispers, she has morphed into something far greater than the sum of her parts.

Now she is a demon, built of blood and bone and sustained purely by revenge.

Those who wish to call her merely need say her name thirteen times while looking into a mirror (or just three times if the mirror has magic of any kind to it). Those who seek revenge may call upon her for aid, but only if she deems their need worthy. Those who call her on a whim or a dare will shortly find themselves in dire straits.

In the mirror, she looks at first like a glare of light, then as a skeleton or dead body, then as a woman with the face of a nightmare—empty eye sockets and a single bloodshot eye in her forehead. Her mouth is full of sharpened teeth, and the claws of her hands are curled and silver‑tipped. Her skin and dress are so coated in blood it’s impossible to tell where they end and she begins. As she starts to crawl from the mirror, she moves faster and faster until she pulls herself fully free as a corporeal being. Typically, Hell Mary will not attack creatures that she deems as innocent or unworthy of revenge, unless they provoke her in some way.

**Motive:** Revenge

**Environment:** Anywhere with a mirror

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Intimidation as level 7

**Combat:** Hell Mary merely has to scream at, strangle, or scratch a foe within immediate range to inflict 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).

She can curse a creature within short range to experience intense fear, stunning them for a minute or until they succeed at an Intellect defense roll to break free.

She can possess a willing summoner for a few rounds in order to enact revenge on their behalf. During this time her summoner can only watch, feel, and listen as Hell Mary gets them their retribution.

**Interaction:** Hell Mary only cares about one thing— revenge. All other topics are likely to fall upon deaf ears.

**Use:** A character was attacked and calls upon Hell Mary to help them seek revenge. Someone is using Hell Mary to seek revenge (rightfully or wrongfully) upon a character.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Internet D@Emon <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Weird apps and viruses are a frequent problem on internet-enabled devices, even more so when magic is brought into the mix. Internet d@emons are semi-sentient bits of code that live in computers and smart devices. Initially created to be harmless or even helpful (fulfilling a simple purpose such as converting files, refining data searches, or anonymizing an IP address), they’ve become aggressive and malicious, either deliberately created to cause harm or bucking the constraints of their original code to evolve and multiply. Unsuspecting sorcerers might grab a magical app that promises quicker access to difficult spells or insight on the next big crypto drop, accidentally infecting their devices with a dangerous techno-magical creature.

Most magicians draw the attention of an internet d@emon by using malware cypher apps like EasyMagic.

> Internet d@emons have grown beyond their original programming and function like creatures rather than simple software— essentially, they’re a sort of magical limited artificial intelligence. They’re immune to abilities that only affect non-sentient programs.
>
> Some magicians have tried partnering with a d@emon, allowing it to feed on their magic in exchange for a daily magic-enhancing cypher, but the d@emon’s hunger usually grows too strong for it to resist taking more magic than the character planned for.

**Motive:** Hunger for magic

**Environment:** Computers, smart devices, and areas with strong wireless internet access

**Health:** 9

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short; travels through the internet at nearly instantaneous speed

**Modifications:** Speed defense, perception, and stealth as level 5

**Combat:** A d@emon outside of an internet‑connected device attacks by siphoning magic from a creature within short range, inflicting 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). However, usually the d@emon prefers to remain hidden within a computer or smart device, slowly and gently draining magic from a nearby creature without being noticed.

When a magic-capable creature uses a ten‑minute, one-hour, or ten-hour recovery roll within immediate range of a device with an internet d@emon, subtract 1 from the result of the recovery roll. Over time, the d@emon’s siphoning power strengthens, increasing to 2 or even 3 points taken from every recovery roll. An affected creature can attempt a perception task against the d@emon’s stealth modifier to realize that something is tapping into their magic.

If the character discovers which app or device the d@emon is associated with, deleting the app or destroying the device forces the d@emon to either flee through the internet (requiring its action for one to three rounds, depending on local transmission speeds) or immediately manifest in its visible physical form. If manifested, a d@emon attempts to feed on the weakest foe in the area, and once it is sated it leaves the area (breaking off combat if possible) to find a high-speed wireless internet connection so it can transmit itself far away in search of another victim.

> Once per day, an internet d@emon can create a malware magical app cypher (such as EasyMagic.app), placing it in an app store (physical or online) or sending out a burst of emails with a link to where the app can be downloaded.
>
> Interaction: D@emons are persistent and reasonably clever. They can be bargained with or bribed, but they tend to be greedy and would rather hide or pretend to leave than make a deal.
>
> Use: An internet d@emon usually starts out as an innocuous app subtly draining magic, then switches to an active, aggressive mode when discovered or if starved.

**Loot:** A destroyed internet d@emon’s physical form leaves behind a lace-like fragment of magical energy that functions as a meditation aid cypher.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Pollution Goblin <---> 2 (6) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Pollution goblins are strange child-sized creatures that arise in environments where pollution or toxic waste is common. Their green skin is covered in scabs and pustules, except where it looks melted by acid, and their eyes have a wicked green glow that’s faintly visible in the dark. They don’t seem to have much of a culture or society, roaming around polluted areas like scavenging insects. They often ignore each other’s presence and never attack each other, but they immediately unite against a common foe if any of them are threatened. A pollution goblin’s semi-liquefied body can slide up or down any firm surface, allowing them to climb anywhere with ease. Pollution goblins have bones and internal organs, but they’re oddly shaped and don’t match those of any known creature. Because of this, and how they quickly melt away if killed, they might actually be artificial beings like homunculi, or inanimate matter given life like an elemental. They seem to arise spontaneously in locations where pollution reaches a threshold, and they don’t reproduce in the normal biological sense. Pollution goblins are stupid and easily tricked, but it doesn’t take long for them to realize they’ve been deceived, and they always make sure to punish someone who fools them.

**Motive:** Hunger for flesh; spreading filth

**Environment:** Anywhere there is pollution, in groups of three to ten

**Health:** 8

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points

**Armor:** 1 (5 against poison and radiation)

**Movement:** Short; short when climbing

**Modifications:** Might defense as level 3; perception and stealth as level 5; see through deception as level 1

**Combat:** Pollution goblins use scavenged weapons to attack prey at range, preferring stolen pistols (usually with only one or two bullets left) or hurled containers of toxic goo. When up close, they bite.

A pollution goblin’s body is infused with dangerous chemicals. Any person spending their turn within immediate range of a pollution goblin must succeed at a Might defense roll or become sick. Within an hour, all their tasks are hindered, and for every 24 hours that pass, they must make another Might defense roll or move one step down the damage track (a success ends the sickness).

Pollution goblins regain 2 points of health per round.

**Interaction:** Pollution goblins have a rudimentary understanding of whatever human language is dominant in their area. Most conversations with them are about acquiring food and protecting and expanding their territory (which means spreading contaminants over a wider area).

**Use:** Pollution goblins are an early symptom of a larger and greater problem. By the time a group of them is discovered, the area is already poisoned and will take time and money to contain and clean up.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Television Thoughtform <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
A television thoughtform is a nexus of images and videos from TV programming, brought to life—usually accidentally—by unconscious or deliberate magic. Typically, the thoughtform looks like a specific television character in the real world, but objects and even locations have been known to manifest as thoughtforms. The thoughtform isn’t initially aware that they’re a manifestation of a fictional television program, but over time they usually come to realize their artificial origin and that the “world” they lived in and the people they knew there weren’t real. Most thoughtforms adapt to their new situation, but some have a traumatic response to their new reality and become dangerous.

> A thoughtform is a thought or idea made real, usually through intense belief, concentration, or magic. Buddhist philosophy has a similar concept called a “tulpa.”
>
> It’s possible to create a thoughtform of a real person out of documentary footage, newscasts, interviews, or other media where the person on the screen is portraying themselves. These thoughtforms tend to have a poor time adjusting to a reality where they are an artificial copy of a real person, rejected by their friends and loved ones.

**Motive:** Acceptance; adjustment to the real world

**Environment:** Anywhere their fictional self would feel comfortable

**Health:** 9

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 or 6 points (see below)

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Intellect defense as level 4; assuming their fictional role as level 5

**Combat:** Television thoughtforms attack using whatever methods are appropriate for their character. For most people, this means improvised weapons like chairs and baseball bats, inflicting 3 points of damage. Battle-competent characters such as police officers, sci-fi soldiers, and fantasy heroes tend to use lethal weapons like pistols and swords, inflicting 6 points of damage.

Thoughtforms can incidentally alter their own reality in small ways relevant to their fictional self, such as suddenly changing outfits to match the situation, producing useful equipment (like a weapon or mobile phone) out of nothing, or instantly recovering 3 points of health. The thoughtform usually hand-waves how they were able to do this; pressing them on these abilities eventually leads to them learning that they’re a thoughtform. These abilities might happen automatically as part of the thoughtform’s action, or they might use an action to duck out of sight and return after the change has happened.

**Interaction:** A thoughtform that’s ignorant of their true nature acts exactly as their fictional self would. An aware thoughtform develops their own personality over time, which might be similar to their fictional persona or radically different as a rebellion against how they were “forced” to act.

> Use: Thoughtforms create quirky, interesting, and misleading encounters where PCs and NPCs mistake them for cosplayers, famous actors, people experiencing delusions (about a fictional city or a “hologram program”), or odd local residents (such as a hard-boiled detective or a high-school sports hero or bully). They sometimes know secret information about the media they’re from.

**Loot:** Although a dead thoughtform and their equipment slowly fades away into nothingness, sometimes they leave behind an interesting cypher.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Urban Brownie <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
While most people are familiar with rural brownies with their wizened, ragged appearance and their penchant for helping with farming tasks, the urban brownie is a very different type of entity. Having adapted to live in cities and decent-sized towns, urban brownies tend to care much more about their appearance and prefer less outdoorsy forms of labor.

Most are natty dressers, often altering the clothing of large dolls or young children to create well-heeled outfits for themselves. They prefer to have their own private spaces in people’s homes or businesses, but will inhabit small shelters or niches if they can’t find any other home. Many live in coffee shops, finding the offerings of caffeine and pastries well worth the tasks they perform in thanks (usually cleaning, making elegantly lettered signs, and organizing cupboards). They’re most active in the evenings and overnight, but some choose to acclimate to the rhythm of the city they live in and can be seen during the day.

A brownie who feels insulted, disrespected, or unappreciated will quickly become malicious and spread word about whoever treated them so poorly.

**Motive:** Comfort and security

**Environment:** Homes and shops where food is present

**Health:** 9

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Speed defense and movement as level 4 due to size and quickness; perception, riddles, and tricks as level 4

**Combat:** Brownies are tricksters through and through, and nearly all their abilities fall into this category.

Mend: Spend two rounds mending something that is broken (up to level 5). The item works for two rounds before it returns to its broken state. (This ability does not work on used cyphers or depleted artifacts.)

Needle and Thread: Magically sew a creature’s clothing, shoes, accessories, or skin to something else, making it difficult for the creature to move. The creature’s actions are hindered until they succeed on a level 3 Might defense roll to break free.

No See Me: Take the shape of a small object in the vicinity, such as a cookie jar, shoe, or vase. The brownie is indistinguishable from the object, and the effect lasts for one minute or until they take a combat action.

Put That Anywhere: Move an item within short range in such a way that it trips up and injures a foe, such as slamming a door closed, knocking a rake across a pathway, or dropping a chandelier from the ceiling. The foe takes 3 points of damage and, depending on the circumstances, may be knocked prone if they fail a Might defense roll.

> Shine-Shine-Shine: Spend two rounds making a (willing) person, place, or thing so pretty that it is wonderful to look upon. All foes are unable to look away for one round and lose their next action. All allies are bolstered by the beauty and gain an asset on their next action.
>
> Interaction: Brownies are typically mischievous and tricky, with a love of puns, riddles, and puzzles. They appreciate those who appreciate them and are a bit like crows in that they long-remember the faces of those who have helped or harmed them.

**Use:** Brownies are usually supportive characters in a story, but they may be vexing tricksters—or even outright antagonists if living in a home where the primary foe (or a player character) mistreats them. They’re usually overlooked by nonmagical people, so they often witness secret events and have interesting information.

> \*Rural brownies have the same stats as urban brownies. The differences between them are mostly in appearance and personality, as rural brownies tend to dress in rags, prefer to work at night, and are not opposed to doing manual labor outdoors in all manner of weather—provided they’re well-rewarded.

VULTURE SPIRIT 3(9)

Vulture spirits look like tall humans with bald heads and horrible, hunched posture. They blend in, and they like it that way. Vulture spirits subsist on other people’s pain and misery, which has led to a bad reputation that’s hard to shake.

Despite prevalent misconceptions, vulture spirits generally prefer not to cause pain and misery—they just feed on what’s already present, providing relief in the process. They’re gentle and reserved, with soft, scratchy voices. The most well-known and well-respected vulture spirits work in medical professions and form symbiotic relationships with their patients.

**Motive:** Consume anguish

**Environment:** Anywhere pain and misery can be found

**Health:** 10

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Intellect defense, perception, and stealth as level 5

**Combat:** Vulture spirits are rarely violent; they attack when threatened, to defend chosen allies, or out of desperation. A dying vulture spirit may use their last strength to pounce on a creature they judge to be an easy target, subsequently using the pain they inflict to restore their own health.

Vulture spirits gain 1 point of health for every minute spent in physical contact with someone (other than a vulture spirit) experiencing pain or suffering, such as a creature below half its normal health or Pool points, a debilitated PC, or someone with a chronic illness. Recovery rolls made while in contact with a vulture spirit are increased by 3 points.

A vulture spirit can use the following magical abilities.

Recalling the Worst: Open their mouth and emit a short-distance blast of energy. If the foe fails an Intellect defense roll, they take 4 points of damage and lose their next action as they relive their worst memory.

Remote Draining: If a creature within short range is experiencing pain or suffering, the vulture spirit can use their action to drain it from that creature. The spirit gains 1 point of health and the creature’s affliction is alleviated for one round.

**Interaction:** Vulture spirits are clever and shy. They can speak human languages but revert to bird sounds such as screeching, clicking, and trilling when stressed. Though they forage for pain to consume alone, they prefer to live in large groups.

**Use:** Vulture spirits are good for creating eerie encounters about sickness and pain, especially if the player characters mistake the spirit as the cause of the trouble rather than incidental to it.

**Loot:** A vulture spirit’s pockets are full of feathers, altogether which function as a curative cypher.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Witchfox <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
A witchfox is a supernatural creature whose natural form is that of a fox, but they can transform into a human form and walk among regular people. Like humans, some are evil, some are good, and most are in the middle, but many of the stories and legends are about the bad ones. A witchfox’s fur is usually red, black, or silver, but some are pure white. Witchfoxes often have multiple tails (up to nine); most human legends say the creature gains more tails as it gets older, wiser, and more powerful.

Witchfoxes don’t have human morals, but ones friendly to humans try their best to adapt, with mixed results. For example, a witchfox thinks it’s fine to steal something from a person they dislike and give that item as a gift to someone they like. Most witchfoxes are afraid of dogs and avoid spending time near them or near people who have them.

Witchfoxes are also known as vulps or fox sorcerers.

**Motive:** Preying on or living in human society; knowledge and power

**Environment:** Anywhere humans can live, or houses or dens in the forest

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Disguise and social interaction as level 6

**Combat:** A witchfox in fox form can attack with their bite, and in human form they use human weapons, but in general they prefer magic. Most witchfoxes can use the following abilities.

Bewilder: The witchfox enchants a foe within short range who fails an Intellect defense roll. The foe turns on their allies, wanders off, or waits quietly, as directed by the witchfox. This lasts for one minute, or ends early if the character succeeds on an

Intellect defense roll as part of their turn.

Feed: The witchfox draws on the life force of an adjacent dead or nearly dead person (GM’s discretion), or eats the heart of a dead person, restoring 4 points of health and easing all tasks for the next day.

Human Guise: The witchfox changes shape into a human form (any gender, any age). They usually have a “tell” indicating their nonhuman nature, such as a fox’s tail, a fox-like face, fur on their body, or a fox’s shadow. The witchfox can revert to their fox form as part of another action.

Illusion: The witchfox creates a nonmoving illusion in a short area, such as making a hovel look like a home or an empty glade seem eerie and oppressive. The illusion lasts as long as the witchfox remains within a long distance.

Magical Blast: The witchfox attacks a creature within short range with electricity, fire, or poison, inflicting 4 points of Might or Speed damage (ignores Armor).

**Interaction:** A witchfox in human form tries to keep up the pretense of being human for as long as possible. Once their true nature is revealed, they’re likely to bargain for what they want (a home, safety, their magical cravings) or attack or flee if negotiations turn against them.

**Use:** A witchfox is potentially a threat, thief, criminal, rival, informant, or romantic partner, depending on their personal attitude and the reaction of the player characters. They like to trade secrets they know in exchange for safety and companionship.

**Loot:** A witchfox usually has one or two cyphers and some magical ingredients. Most of their other wealth is actually leaves, twigs, stones, and scrap paper, all covered with illusions.


{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Zorp <---> 1 (3) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Zorps are an obnoxious but mostly harmless kind of gremlin. Nobody is quite sure where they come from; they tend to show up randomly with no prompting, but seem to be drawn to people who use magic. As soon as there’s one causing trouble somewhere, more are soon to follow. Zorps combine the most destructive aspects of puppies and young children; they tear up clothing and decorations to craft simple “costumes,” scribble on walls and papers, eat ingredients left out on the kitchen counter, make armpit farts during sentimental moments, whisper insults at guests, spill potted plants, and leave little poops in the middle of the floor.

Zorps communicate effectively with each other using grunts, nonsense words, gestures, and facial expressions. After hearing any spoken language, they can speak and understand that language for a few minutes, but their grammar and vocabulary are childlike. They can easily mimic a person’s voice, but only seem to do so to make fun of them or mislead others.

> Zorps using their native “language” sound vaguely French. “Zagree goo!” “Zoot lorz!” “Encroy!” “Stoopy fohn!” “Say tee nowee!”
>
> Zorps also tend to “die” if startled or hurt—it’s their automatic reaction to a potential threat, much like a possum “playing possum.”

**Motive:** Mischief and curiosity

**Environment:** Anywhere there is potential for trouble

**Health:** 6

**Damage Inflicted:** 2 points

**Movement:** Short; immediate when climbing or jumping

**Modifications:** Attacks as level 2; Speed defense as level 3 due to size and quickness; stealing and stealth as level 4

**Combat:** Zorps only attack when they are threatened, usually by biting or stabbing with an improvised sharp object, but they can just as easily harm foes by dropping heavy things from above, activating dangerous devices in the area, or tripping opponents onto pointy edges and corners. Any of these attacks inflicts 2 points of damage.

Zorps are notoriously hard to kill. If an attack would reduce a zorp’s health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled in the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zorp takes no damage but appears to “die” in a burst of purple liquid resembling paint, leaving behind no body. (The zorp actually has scuttled to a hiding space within immediate range and will move farther away as soon as they can do so safely, returning later after recovering health or when their curiosity gets the better of them.)

**Interaction:** Zorps seem to have the intelligence of a smart dog or a typical toddler but are easily distracted from attempts to communicate. Bribes of candy, wrapping paper, and loud toys can hold their attention for a minute or so.

**Use:** Zorps are chaotic and mischievous, with no regard for the consequences of their actions or the feelings of others. They’re not intentionally malicious, but they can cause trouble and outright harm simply by “playing” too hard with important things.

**Loot:** Zorps rarely hold onto anything for more than a few minutes, but sometimes they might have a stolen manifest cypher.

## Modern Magic Cyphers

The Cypher System Rulebook assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but depending on the nature of magic in the modern fantasy setting, some or all cyphers might be physical objects (manifest cyphers) with magical powers. This immediately creates a different gameplay dynamic than a game that uses only subtle cyphers. First, it means that the PCs can exchange cyphers with each other, allowing them better optimizations of their abilities and counteracting their weaknesses. Second, it means their cyphers can be stolen from them, forcing them to adapt to a situation without their extra magical tricks. Third, it probably means that fantastic cyphers become the norm because magic easily allows for fantastic effects.


### Manifest Cypher Forms

The form a manifest cypher takes— such as a potion or scroll—doesn’t affect its abilities at all. A potion that eases the user’s next task by three steps is functionally identical to a magical scroll that does the same thing. The only difference is the look and feel (campaign flavor) in the story.

| 00    | You’re safe now         |


### Apps as Cyphers

Apps are a great cypher option for modern, urban settings. The character will need a working device, such as a cell phone or a cloud storage artifact, to buy, download, or otherwise gain apps. However, in most cases the device doesn’t need to be working to activate the app. Draining the device’s battery or turning it off doesn’t affect the app or someone’s ability to use it. (Breaking the device, losing it, or having it stolen might be another matter.)

Because each app is a unique magical item (meaning only one exists in the world, unlike a regular app, which can be downloaded by everyone who wants it), they’re harder to find than regular apps. Instead, you likely need to purchase one directly from the person who created it. Some campaign settings might have physical app stores, while others might require clandestine trades, electronic thievery, or some other means of securing the app. In other settings, an app might be something you download into a modified body part or integrated piece of hardware.


#### Absolute Power

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** App, battery, bone

**Effect:** Powers a single device for a day. The device can be as simple as a cell phone or as complex as a jet airplane, as long as the device’s power requirement is equal to or less than the cypher level. In general, something like a cell phone is a level 1 power requirement, a boat engine is a level 5 power requirement, and a jet airplane is a level 10 power requirement.


#### Algomancy

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** App, bookmark, tarot card

**Effect:** Allows the user to take anything driven by an algorithm (such as video and music services, social media, search engines, and so on) and use it to divine the future. If the user spends one roundstudying the algorithm, then for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, they gain limited precognition and can predict what’s going to happen next. They gain an asset on initiative tasks and all defense rolls. In addition, they can warn their friends of what’s coming, and ease their friends’ next action.


#### Ambiance

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** Key fob, feather, DVD

**Effect:** Allows you to control the lights, sound, and other atmospheric elements within any space that you are in for ten minutes per cypher level. This includes adjusting non-adjustable lights, lighting or blowing out candles, soundproofing, starting or stopping music through any available medium, starting a fire, and so on.


#### Anywhere Web

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Spiderweb, key fob, key

**Effect:** Allows you to access and interact with the internet from anywhere, without needing any type of physical device, including a phone, keyboard, or screen. You can see the internet as if there were a screen in front of you, type as if there were a keyboard, hear as if there were speakers, and speak as if into a microphone. Others you choose within immediate range can also see and hear what you are seeing and hearing (but cannot interact with it). This works even in places where there is no internet connectivity and lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### Below the Law

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** App, temporary tattoo, patch

**Effect:** Once activated, the cypher makes it difficult for any member of the law or people in a position of power to perceive, apprehend, or punish you. This includes police, guards, the mayor, mob bosses, regular bosses, and so on. All tasks involving illegal or unsanctioned activities are eased, including stealing, sneaking, getting away, escaping bonds, and so on. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### Best Gift

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Granny square, key, candle

**Effect:** The user picks someone they know, and the cypher transforms into a beautifully wrapped box that person can hold in their hand. Inside the box is a small, thoughtful gift (whose value does not exceed a moderately priced item) that the recipient will truly love.


#### Beverage Bestie

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, mug, charm

**Effect:** The user picks someone they know, and that person will have their favorite morning beverage delivered to them at their bedside at the exact moment they are ready for it. The user doesn’t need to know their chosen person’s favorite beverage, their location, or when they will wish for it—the magic takes care of it.


#### Borrowed Familiar

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Feather, cat’s whisker, figurine of a dog

**Effect:** Activating the cypher creates a living version of the creature it represented. This creature is actually the clone of another magic user’s familiar that was stored in the object. For the next day per cypher level, the creature becomes the user’s temporary familiar, providing an asset to all magic-related actions (including defense actions). The creature cannot be harmed, but at the end of its time, it fades away.


#### Brain Overclock

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** App, mushroom, hair clip

**Effect:** Amplifies the user’s mental abilities so their senses are keener and their brain works far beyond its normal capacity.

Roll for effect:

| D6  | Effect                                                        |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Increases Intellect Edge by 1 for one hour                    |
| 2   | Trained in Intellect Defense for one hour                     |
| 3   | Add +1 damage to all Intellect-based attacks for one hour     |
| 4   | Eases all Intellect-based attacks for one hour                |
| 5   | Restores Intellect Pool to full                               |
| 6   | Become trained in two noncombat Intellect skills for one hour |


#### Burn Your Bridges

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, candle, bones

**Effect:** Covers and destroys the user’s trail in such a way that it makes them very hard to follow. This might include covering their scent, destroying ladders or bridges, creating face-recognition distortion, blurring their license plate, or establishing a false trail. Anyone attempting to follow or track them for one day per cypher level finds their actions hindered by two steps.


#### Burner Phone

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Key fob, charm, hair clip

**Effect:** Creates or transforms into a basic mobile phone that can make and receive telephone calls and text messages like a prepaid phone. Calls and texts made from this phone appear as “UNKNOWN CALLER” with the number obscured; once contacted, the recipient can call or text this phone like any other phone. The phone uses normal (prepaid) cellular connections, but has no internet access or other functions other than sending and receiving calls and texts.

The phone lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which it becomes inert, nonfunctional, and untrackable (like a mobile phone that has been broken and its chip removed). The user of the cypher can end it early as an action by speaking a command word or physically breaking it.


#### Cloak of the Crafter

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Oil, moss, granny square

**Effect:** When activated, it cloaks the user in what looks like a handmade wrap, such as a shawl, scarf, or cloak, for an hour per cypher level. During that time, the user’s crafting-related tasks are eased, and everything they craft is one level higher than it normally would be. In addition, the user can find up to two ingredients they need (up to the level of the cypher) in the pockets of the cloak.


#### Dancing on Air

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** Feather, bullet, charm

**Effect:** The user is lifted a foot (30 cm) or so off the ground, as if there is a pocket of air between them and whatever surface is below them. They can move normally as if walking across a smooth, flat surface. This works even if the substance below them would not normally hold them, such as water or thin ice. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### Dumpster Fire

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Matchbook, coaster, rope

**Effect:** Instantly transforms to become a large, contained fire that creates a deep feeling of gloom and despair in all creatures chosen by the user within long range of it who fail an Intellect defense roll. Any negative actions the user takes against those creatures (including combat) are eased by one step, and any positive actions they take for those creatures (such as attempting to inspire them) are hindered by one step.


#### Duplicity Window

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** Sticker, flyer, stamp

**Effect:** When this cypher is stuck on any window or other transparent item, the user can alter what can be seen from the other side. While this illusion might be used in a simple way, such as creating a blackout window on a car, it could also be much more complex, such as creating an elaborate dance party inside an otherwise empty apartment. The illusion level is equal to the cypher level and fools the vision of living creatures as well as that of magical and electronic eyes. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### Exceptional Engine

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Herbs, battery, flip lighter

**Effect:** When activated near an engine, computer, device, program, or piece of machinery, the affected target works exceptionally well for the next ten minutes per cypher level, easing all tasks involved with operating it. For example, a car handles better, a hacking program works faster, an elevator door closes before a pursuer can get on, and so on.


#### Extrovert Shield

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** Carved figure, bones, building blocks

**Effect:** Creates the semblance of a being of the user’s choice, such as a human who walks beside them, a bird that sits on their shoulders, or a robot, to act as their shield in social situations. The first time they would take damage from a mental attack, the being absorbs that damage (up to the cypher level) and reflects it back onto the attacker; the user makes an Intellect-based attack roll for this reflected damage. After that, the being disappears.


#### Fade to Black

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Mirror, lapel pin, spiderweb

**Effect:** Turns the user into a shadow for ten minutes per cypher level. During that time, the user looks exactly like their own shadow, is two-dimensional, and can move through any space where light could shine through. As a shadow, the user can make magical attacks but not physical ones. They take no physical damage. However, any successful magical attacks against them inflict +1 point of damage.


#### Faraday Ward

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** App, pocket handkerchief, lapel pin

**Effect:** When activated, the ward protects the user, their items, and their devices from any attempts at scrying, electromagnetic surveillance, and similar observation whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### Fey Collar

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Collar, knitted scarf, necklace

**Effect:** When placed around a creature’s neck, the collar locks and prevents the wearer from using magic of any kind (up to the level of the cypher). If the creature is a PC, each time they try to use magic they must succeed at an Intellect-based roll against the cypher level; otherwise that attempt is blocked. The collar lasts for ten minutes per cypher level and then disintegrates.


#### Ghost Tag

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Spray paint, feather, lipstick

**Effect:** Allows the user to leave their tag on someone else’s graffiti, painting, or public artwork. The tag includes a spoken message up to twenty words long and is invisible except to the creature the user designates. That creature can touch the tag and hear the entirety of the message.


#### Girl Moss

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Mushroom, chalk, seed packet

**Effect:** The user melds into whatever soft thing is near them, such as moss, earth, or a blanket, and becomes nearly indistinguishable from that thing. For a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, they gain an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected (even by magic). Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in any way breaks the effect.


#### Got Your Back

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Napkin, straw, coaster

**Effect:** The cypher turns bright blue in the presence of any type of drug, poison, or other detrimental or dangerous substance whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level. The effect lasts for one day.


#### Gravity Denied

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, feather, balloon

**Effect:** The user no longer has to follow gravity’s laws. For one minute per cypher level, they can walk (or crawl or run) on steep inclines and horizontal surfaces (such as walls and cliffs) as if they were on flat ground. When using this ability, “down” for them is either the surface they are walking on or the normal orientation of gravity (their choice).


#### Great Hair Day

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Hair clip, twigs, bones

**Effect:** When activated, the cypher makes the user’s hair look like it did on their best hair day ever. For the next 24 hours, they have an asset in all confidence-based actions, social and otherwise.


#### Growwell

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Herbs, seed packet, bouquet of flowers

**Effect:** Causes a garden to sprout in any immediate area. The garden is self-sustaining and doesn’t need soil, sun, or water. It includes flowers, vegetables, and herbs, and lasts for a number of months equal to the cypher level.


#### Handwave

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Fingerless glove, ring, temporary tattoo

**Effect:** When the user places this cypher upon their hand as an action, they can take three actions on their next turn.


#### Hashtag

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, flyer, electronic stylus

**Effect:** The user chooses a word or short phrase when activating this cypher. For an hour per cypher level, that word will glow when they encounter it in their environment in a way that only they can perceive, allowing them to pick it out from its surroundings easily. This glow will appear around the word itself as well as symbols and objects. For example, if they choose “apple,” they will sense a glow around the word in print, around an actual apple, and around the symbol of an apple logo on a computer. This doesn’t extend their range of vision farther than they can normally see.

This cypher adjusts to be beneficial to the user. For example, if a non-sighted character uses hashtag, the cypher might create a sound or sensation around the chosen word rather than a glow, or the glow might be visible in their mind’s eye instead.


#### Here All Along

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** App, needle and thread, ID card

**Effect:** Allows the user to instantly create a long trail on the internet for someone that they just made up. This includes social media accounts, a personal or business website, photos and videos, friends, and so on. The information stays on the internet forever.


#### Instant Automobile

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Key, charm, temporary tattoo

**Effect:** Creates or transforms into a large automobile that can carry up to eight people. The user or other characters must steer the automobile as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the automobile grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the automobile can move a short distance each round under its own power. The automobile lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.

> The vehicle created by an instant automobile cypher is utilitarian and unremarkable rather than flashy, more like a station wagon, generic van, panel truck, or SUV. In some settings, local laws might require these temporary magical vehicles to have a specific color or text to easily identify them as such, including a unique license plate that can be tracked like any registered vehicle. Likewise, an instant motorcycle cypher creates a functional but not particularly “sexy” motorbike.


#### Instant Delivery

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** App, feather, stamp

**Effect:** Allows the user to have a letter, small package, or any object up to about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) delivered almost instantaneously to someone. If the object is dangerous, such as a bomb, the recipient’s level must be equal to or less than the cypher’s. The user must know the person’s name and at least one small fact about them, but doesn’t need to know their location. Within a round of having left the user, the package will arrive within a short distance of the recipient.


#### Instant Motorcycle

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Playing card, key, metal flask

**Effect:** Creates or transforms into a motorcycle that can comfortably carry one person (or two people sitting tandem). The user or other characters must steer the motorcycle as normal. At cypher level 4 and higher, the motorcycle grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the motorcycle can move a short distance each round under its own power. The motorcycle lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.


#### Lie To Me

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Contact lenses, goggles, mask

**Effect:** Once activated and worn, allows the user to see through all deceptions, mirages, and illusions (up to the level of the cypher) for a day. Also provides the user with an asset on lying, cheating, illusions, and other deception tasks.


#### Light ‘Em Up

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Laser light pointer, pair of glasses, key fob

**Effect:** Activating the cypher causes a powerful beam of magic light to erupt from the user’s body part they choose. The beam stretches a short range and inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. It affects even creatures (such as ghosts and vampires) that normally can’t be harmed by mundane weapons. Once activated, the weapon is active for ten minutes.


#### Lucky Charm

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Worry stone, fuzzy dice, deck of cards

**Effect:** Rubbing the lucky charm draws a tiny bit of luck away from someone else and gives it to the user, causing something to happen that makes the user’s next action a little easier. This might be a friend showing up, a tool appearing just where the user needs it, or the traffic lights changing to green just as the user arrives. Effectively, using this cypher grants the player a player intrusion without having to spend 1 XP.


#### Magic Aura Tracker

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, bus ticket, 3D glasses

**Effect:** User can view the cypher’s symbols to see if the ambient power of magic in the area is normal, high (increased capabilities or prone to disruptive surges), low (decreased effects or scarcity), or absent. It can also be configured to display power levels for individual kinds of magic (fire, necromancy, illusion) separately from the standard readings. This lasts for five hours per cypher level.


#### Mental Load Alleviator

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Worry stone, pen, figurine

**Effect:** Helps take on some of the user’s mental loads for the next day, including creating shopping lists, organizing the calendar, project management, working on spells, and decision making. During this time, the user gains +1 to their Intellect Edge and +5 to their Intellect Pool (+7 to their Intellect Pool if the cypher is level 9 or higher).


#### Merciful Memory

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Candle, charm, 3D glasses

**Effect:** For one willing target (including the user), the user can alter a negative memory into one that’s mor positive. Altering the memory takes a few rounds, depending on the intricacy and difficulty of the memory. Once the memory is altered, it remains that way for a day. During that time, the target gains +5 to their Intellect Pool and all tasks involving the memory (such as talking to the person the memory’s about) are eased.


#### Next You

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Comb, mirror, hair pin

**Effect:** Activating the cypher brings up a magical avatar of the user. The user can alter all parts of their avatar, include hair color and style, clothing, jewelry, makeup, gender, height, and so on. After one round, the changes they’ve made to the avatar are made to their own body. The effect lasts for one hour per cypher level.


#### No Take Backs

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Temporary tattoo, playing card, skein of yarn

**Effect:** Activating the cypher creates an invisible bubble around the user. The next time a foe inflicts damage on the user, the bubble registers the type of attack (such as melee, magic, or ranged) and alters itself to protect the user from the next attack of that type. When the user would next take damage from the same type of attack, the bubble absorbs all of it and then pops.


#### Pickpocket

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** App, stone, key fob

**Effect:** The next time the user attempts to pickpocket someone, they automatically succeed against a target whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s, and they gain an asset to their task against targets whose level is higher than the cypher’s. In addition to the items the target has in their pocket, the user gains a random cypher (of a level equal to or less than the level of the pickpocket cypher).


#### Pocket Protector

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Metal flask, flip lighter, book

**Effect:** If the user is shot with a bullet, arrow, or other projectile, the cypher just happens to be in the right place to protect them from all damage. Unlike a standard cypher, this protective effect occurs without the user’s action to activate it. Once used to protect against one attack chosen by the user, the cypher turns to dust.


#### Portal Stone

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Stone, marble, baseball

**Effect:** Placing an object beneath the portal stone and letting it rest there for one round shifts it to an undiscoverable location, such as another dimension or world (depending on the setting). The item can only be retrieved by holding the portal stone and whispering the name of the object.


#### Power Device

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** App, flip lighter, seed packet

**Effect:** Magically powers one device that can fit within an area a short distance across. The device is now fully powered, charged, or fueled. If the cypher is used on an automobile, for example, the gas tank is full. If used on a flashlight, the battery is fully charged.


#### Power House

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Stone, wood, building box

**Effect:** Expands into an instant tiny home complete with a washroom, sleeping area, and kitchen space. The entirety of the structure is about 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet (6 m by 6 m by 3.5 m). It lasts for 24 hours, at which point it and all nonliving things inside it disintegrate.


#### Presto Change-O

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Skein of yarn, key fob, key

**Effect:** Allows the user to alter the appearance of a single vehicle whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level for the next day. This could be a minor alteration, such as changing the paint color and the license plate number, or it could be a major one, such as changing a horse-drawn carriage into a go-kart. The new vehicle must be able to traverse the same type of terrain as the original (the user can change a canoe into a speedboat, for example, but not into a plane or a race car).


#### Puzzle Box

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Building block, flip lighter, locket

**Effect:** Allows the user to put a creature (up to the level of the cypher) inside an item the user touches with the cypher. The creature shrinks to fit inside the item. While inside the item, the creature is in stasis and cannot take any actions. They cannot be harmed in any way and they do not experience time moving forward. The creature stays inside permanently, unless they are released by magic or until the user chooses to let them out.


#### Quick Pic

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** App, pen, stone with a hole in it

**Effect:** Allows the user to snap a quick image of whatever they point it at. The image stays perfectly in their mind for the next 24 hours. By touching an appropriate device, they can download the image, print it out, or digitally alter it. At the end of 24 hours, all versions of the image, including the one in their head, disappear.


#### Quick Pickup

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, key, fidget toy

**Effect:** For a number of hours equal to the cypher level, anytime the user needs a ride somewhere, one instantly appears. This could be a rideshare, a city bike, a horse, a canoe, a friend with a car, a helicopter, or something else, as the GM determines.


#### Real Fake

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, playing card, ticket

**Effect:** When placed against any form of ID, such as a driver’s license, birth certificate, or passport, the cypher instantly transforms into a perfect copy of that ID, including photos, watermarks, and any other identifying or verifying features. The duplicate lasts for a number of days equal to the cypher level.


#### Repair Module

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Remote control, bullet, needle and thread

**Effect:** Repairs a single device or machine of any kind (up to the level of the cypher) once. This could work on an artifact, a computer, a piece of lab equipment, a mechanical cider press, a furnace, and so on. The user doesn’t need any knowledge of the machine or what’s wrong with it, but they must be able to touch the machine and continue to do so for the length of the repair. The repair takes one minute per level of the machine.


#### Safe Space

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** App, knitted scarf, letter

**Effect:** Allows the user to create a temporary safe space around them that takes the form of their choosing, such as a bed, bathroom, mossy grove, and so on. The place looks, sounds, and feels just as the user imagines it. During that time, no one and nothing outside the space can see, hear, or interact with the user in any way, nor can they see, hear, or interact with anything outside their safe space. While in their safe space, they restore a number

of points equal to the cypher level, distributing them as they see fit among their Pools. When they return, it’s as though they never went away and no time has passed. They can remain in the space for up to one hour per cypher level.


#### Screen Control

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** App, mirror, granny square

**Effect:** A technological screen (a television, computer monitor, smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.


#### Social Battery

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Battery, doll, feather

**Effect:** Allows you to recharge your social battery, providing you with an asset on all positive social interactions, including persuasion, charm, flirtation, and succor. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### Soul Saver

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** Egg, battery, cross-stitch square

**Effect:** Brings a dead creature whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s back to life for ten minutes per cypher level. PCs are automatically brought back for the duration. The creature is exactly as they were in life, with the same stats, personality, knowledge, and so on, but only has 2 points of health or Might. If the creature’s health or Might Pool is healed to full in some way during this time, they return to life permanently, but with a 3-point reduction in their maximum health or Might Pool.


#### Stay Down

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Nail polish, glove, stick

**Effect:** Upon activating the cypher, the user’s hand crackles with power and noise. They emit a concussive blast at a single foe within long range, inflicting 3 points of damage, knocking them prone, and stunning them for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.


#### Take Me There

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Crayon, chalk, lipstick

**Effect:** The user spends a few rounds drawing a map of somewhere they’re trying to get to. Even if the map is not the least bit accurate, they will sense a thread of magic leading them to their desired destination. If the place they seek is hidden, they must make an Intellect roll against its level to see if they succeed (the cypher provides an asset). The thread lasts for one day per cypher level or until they reach their destination, whichever is sooner.


#### Talk to Me

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Spiderweb, flyer, building blocks

**Effect:** The user can talk to any creature that is part of a structure, such as a mermaid in a fountain statue, a stone gargoyle on a skyscraper, or a dragon-shaped doorbell on a private home. The user can ask them a number of questions equal to the cypher level and get true answers. The questions must pertain to something the creature would know, such as something they saw or heard in the area, something they felt, or who made them.


#### Teleportation Block

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Bird’s nest, remote control, building block

**Effect:** A short area within immediate range of the user becomes warded against any teleportation effect or other ability that allows travel without direct physical movement (including abilities specifically meant to get around obstacles, such as Bypass Barrier). Any creature whose level is less than the cypher level can’t use these methods to get in or out. Player characters using such abilities must succeed at an Intellect-based task with a difficulty equal to the cypher level in order to enter or leave the area. The block lasts for one day per cypher level.


#### Through the Window

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** App, mirror, flyer

**Effect:** The user chooses any window they can see, and they are able to look through it as if they were standing right in front of it. The window does not need to be transparent, the user does not need to stay in sight of the window after they choose it, and no one else can perceive what they’re doing. While they are looking through the window, they can wink to change their vision back to their current location, then wink again to return to the window. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level or until they choose to end it.


#### Time Ticket

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Bus ticket, moss, remote control

**Effect:** For the next day, no matter what time the user leaves or what hurdles they encounter, they will arrive exactly on time for the event, ride, or other activity. Busses and planes will not leave without them, the play or movie will not start until they arrive, and they’ll meet people exactly when they said they would. (Note that this doesn’t change how the user gets there— they may still sit in traffic forever or get stuck in the security line.) Their traveling companions, if any, enjoy the same benefit as long as they stick with the user.


#### Tunnel Traverser

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Coveralls, poncho, knitted scarf

**Effect:** When activated, it turns the wearer into a liquid or gaseous form of themselves, allowing them to travel through small spaces, such as air ducts, sewer tunnels, tight caverns, and so on. Efforts to detect the user are hindered by two steps (or three steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher), even by magic or security systems. The spaces must be at least 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter and must not be blocked by rocks, doors, and so on. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.


#### What the Doctor Ordered

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** Potion, herbs, candle

**Effect:** Restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the user’s choice of Pools. In addition, the user adds +3 to their next recovery roll.


#### Who’s Looking

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Remote control, glass eye, stone with a hole

**Effect:** For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the cypher vibrates any time the user is being monitored, watched, or tracked by something of the cypher level or less. This includes people, devices, security systems, cameras, spells, and so on.


#### Wire Wraith

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Wire, broken electronics, phone charger

**Effect:** Activating the cypher creates a large wraithlike being that looks as if it’s formed from wire. The wraith is a level 4 incorporeal construct that inflicts 4 points of electrical damage (ignores Armor) with its touch when directed. While the construct persists, the user can use it to slip through small areas, carry an electrical current, or attack foes. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.


#### Wrecking Balls

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Baseball, bouncy ball, marble

**Effect:** When thrown, the ball multiplies into a number of itself equal to the cypher level. Each ball bounces once and then slams into targets within long range chosen by the user. The impact of each ball does 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). If the same foe is hit by two or more balls, they are also knocked prone for one round.


#### You’re Safe Now

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Suspenders, lapel pin, spiderweb

**Effect:** Once the user activates the cypher, it protects them from ambient damage. The next time they would take ambient damage, such as from falling off a roof or being electrocuted by a power line, the cypher absorbs all of the damage (up to the cypher level).


### Software Cyphers


#### EasyMagic.App

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** App

**Effect:** Adds +1 to the user’s Intellect Edge (+2 for cypher level 5 or higher) for the next 24 hours, but only for the purpose of casting spells.

When the cypher is activated, the user attracts the attention of a malevolent internet d@emon, who slides into their internet-connected devices and starts draining their magic. The d@emon remains even after the cypher’s duration expires.


#### Malware Cyphers

EasyMagic.app has a beneficial effect, but also a serious drawback—it attracts a hostile creature to prey upon the user’s magic. The cypher is significantly better than a typical Edge-augmenting cypher like an Intellect booster (lasting 24 hours instead of one hour) in order to trick a naive or greedy character into activating it. Magicians well-versed in cypher lore (and human nature) recognize that this sort of thing is too good to be true.

The GM should feel free to create similar kinds of malware app cyphers that are somewhat better than the standard ones in this chapter or in the Cypher System Rulebook, and give them a harmful side effect. Example malware cypher benefits are curatives that add more points or affect two Pools at once, Effort enhancers that can be used two or more times in an hour, and perfections that don’t require an action to activate (and therefore can affect a roll on the same turn the user activates the cypher).

Example malware cypher drawbacks are hindering the user’s attack spells, debiting the user’s bank account, monitoring the user’s in-person or magical communications, deleting the user’s other magical app cyphers, compelling the user to take a specific action, “locking” one of the user’s spells until they pay a ransom, accessing private data such as passwords or photos, and so on.

Other common malware cypher names are WarlockAntivirus, SpellManager, HexCleaner, TomeBot, and ScryBlocker.
