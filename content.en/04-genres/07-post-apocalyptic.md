# Post-Apocalyptic

Post-apocalyptic literature, movies, and games are a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on the dystopia that follows the fall of civilization. Strictly speaking, post-apocalyptic stories take place after the end of the world. At least, the end of the world for most people. Players take the role of the survivors (or their descendants) trying to persevere in the face of immense hardship. Popular post-apocalyptic scenarios include those set after nuclear war, in the aftermath of a zombie plague, in the months and years following an alien invasion, or after the environment collapses in the face of human overpopulation. Other ways the world could end include a massive meteorite strike, the long-awaited robot uprising, a powerful solar flare that burns out the world's power grids and communications, or even something as prosaic as a global disease pandemic.

## Post-Apocalyptic Character Options

### Alternate Character Roles

Characters who play out the apocalypse itself or who have just survived it and must pick up a few hours, days, or months after the end should choose from an alternate slate of roles. If you begin your game in such a setting, it makes much more sense to let your players choose roles for characters in a modern game.

### Descriptors

In addition to the descriptors in the Cypher System Rulebook, you can widen the options available to the players, allowing them to choose from the descriptors presented here for their characters. A subset of the descriptors in this chapter are species descriptors, which may or may not be appropriate for your players, depending on your setting.

#### Rust and Redemption Descriptors

**Standard:** Bitter, Hopeful, Rusted, Shiny
**Species:** Canien, Felis, Flutter, Mutant

#### Bitter

Someone you cared for wronged you. They may have done so directly by betraying a trust, stealing your supplies, or giving you up to raiders to save their own life. Maybe they did it indirectly by going missing or dying on you. Or maybe it was an organization or institution that let you down. Whatever it was, you’ve spent a lot of time pulled into yourself, paranoid and mistrustful of others. But something’s happened lately that has at least opened you to the possibility of trusting others again. Maybe you have to work with someone else or die. Alternatively, perhaps you’ve decided to try one more time, despite your disillusionment. It’s either that or fully give in to bitterness.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Skeptical:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** You’re always wondering who’s going to wrong you next. You are trained in detecting deception.

**Skill:** You are trained in tracking creatures. If a creature has wronged you, the tracking task is eased.

**Inability:** You have a hard time not letting bitterness stain everything you do. Interaction tasks are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a keepsake from whoever wronged you. It could be an object they once possessed, a picture of them, or something else you associate with what makes you so bitter.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  You found the other PCs in a situation they couldn’t survive. Uncharacteristically, you helped them.
2.  You were facing certain death, but the PCs saved you, for no reason other than they saw your need.
3.  You want to change your ways, and the PCs seem to offer a chance for you to explore that possibility.
4.  You have no idea how you joined the PCs. You’re just going along with it for now until answers present themselves.

#### Canien

You’re an evolved, intelligent dog with the ability to speak and use tools. Some caniens stand upright and have hands, and others are quadrupeds who can use a combination of their front paws and mouth as adroitly as a handed canien; you decide which kind of canien you are. Most canien clothing and equipment accommodates walking on either two feet or four, so that’s normally not an issue. Either way, you’ve got fur, a tail, and a noble dog visage true to your particular line of descent. And like most caniens, you’re loyal to your pack and friends. But you may find strangers a little suspicious, in which case you aren’t shy about letting them know. However, you’re usually willing to entertain the idea that a newcomer may be a friend you just don’t know yet.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Dogged:** +2 to your Might Pool.

**Skill:** You are naturally vigilant. You are trained in perception tasks.

**Skill:** You are playful. You are trained in tasks involving playing physical games.

**Loyal:** If an ally within immediate range descends one or more steps on the damage track, you can take an action immediately but in a restricted fashion. You can use this action either to move the willing ally up to an immediate distance or to attempt a healing task on your ally.

**Bite:** You are practiced in making unarmed bite attacks (light weapon). Enabler.

**Chewer:** You are something of an oral fidgeter, like most caniens. After each ten-hour recovery roll, make a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll. If you fail, you discover you’ve unconsciously been chewing on a piece of your equipment; it’s ruined, at least until it is repaired.

**Inability:** You have a hard time seeing disloyalty in others. Tasks that involve detecting falsehoods are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  One of the other PCs needed help, and you obliged without a second’s hesitation.
2.  The other PCs were going somewhere, and you came along even though they didn’t ask you to.
3.  Aggression got the better of you, and now you’re running from the fallout of that experience.
4.  You feel that one of the other PCs is in danger in some way, and you’d like to help out or keep an eye on them.

#### Felis

You’re an evolved, intelligent cat with the ability to speak and use tools. Felis are equally comfortable running on all fours or standing around in a clowder of other felis gossiping over catswort tea. Your fur is your protection from the elements, but you sometimes wear a harness for your equipment and may adopt boots for rough terrain and hats for fashion or function. Your visage is like that of before-times cats, including piercing, reflective eyes. Like other felis, you are crafty and cautious, unless you feel comfortable with others, in which case you can laze away hours in the sun or a warm spot. But if need be, you are quick to act and are not afraid to use your claws to defend yourself.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Crafty:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** You’re innately curious. You are trained in tasks involving knowledge, figuring out problems, or solving puzzles.

**Skill:** You are agile. You are trained in tasks involving balancing and movement.

**Darksight:** You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.

**Claws:** You are practiced in making unarmed claw attacks (light weapon). Enabler.

**Light on Your Paws:** You ignore the first 4 points of damage you would otherwise suffer from a fall. Enabler.

**Jumpy:** Like most felis, you are a bit high-strung. Anytime another creature acts with surprise against you, make a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll. If you fail, the first action you take on your turn is to flee using your full movement away from whoever surprised you.

**Inability:** You often come across as aloof. Tasks that involve positive social interaction are hindered.

**Inability:** You sometimes get lost in new locations you haven’t visited before. You have an inability in navigation.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  Everything was fine until you were attacked by a raiding band of “cat-skinners.” The PCs helped you fight back or flee.
2.  You saw the PCs up to something, and your curiosity got the better of you, so you followed them.
3.  One of the other PCs invited you to join after they saw you scheme, plot, or solve a difficult problem.
4.  You got lost. The PCs found you and invited you to join their group.

#### Flutter

You emerged from the chrysalis with your mind awash in skills instilled while you matured, as well as knowledge handed down from your ancestors. If the stories are true, some of your knowledge comes from even further back, ceded by godlike “humans” who raised flutters into the light of self-knowledge. That was before humans were lost, leaving the world in ruins. Ruins that are now yours to refurbish and rebuild or, as many prefer, to ignore while you instead go your own way. Humans may have created you, but they’re gone, and you can decide what you think you owe them, if anything.

As a flutter, you are kin to the much smaller natural moths that still flit by night. But you have an internal skeleton and lungs, and are far larger. For all that, you also have wings, a proboscis, and much thinner limbs than the average animal still roaming the world.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Quick:** +2 to your Speed Pool.

**Skill:** You are adept at using your body’s natural patterns of camouflage. You are trained in hiding.

**Darksight:** You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and can see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.

**Fragile:** When you fail a Might defense roll to avoid damage, you take 1 extra point of damage.

**Inability:** You are confused by bright light. Perception tasks are hindered in bright light.

**Erratic Flyer:** You can select Hover as if it were on your type’s list of tier 1 abilities. Your ability to move as described in Hover is due to your wings. In addition to the base ability described for Hover, if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect roll, you can keep your position in the air instead of drifting with the wind or allowing momentum to move you. On a failure, you fly erratically as your action, possibly into the ground, a wall, or the midst of enemies you were trying to avoid. Enabler.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  Some piece of knowledge gleaned from your time in the chrysalis made you seek out and join the PCs.
2.  The ruins are where knowledge of humans exists, and you heard the PCs were headed there.
3.  You overheard the PCs talking about a grand adventure, and you wanted to be part of it.
4.  You zigged when you should have zagged and ran headlong into the PCs. They patched you up and you stayed with them.

#### Hopeful

Despite civilization’s fall, you’re optimistic about what the future could bring, confident that it will be bright. In fact, now that all the old institutions and cares of the world are gone, you hope something better can be rebuilt in its place. It’s possible that you’re bubbly and full of cheer. But you might instead be quietly confident, your hope revealed by the way you always try again if at first you fail. Being hopeful doesn’t mean you’re blind to others’ faults, but you can hope they will do better next time, which might lead you to be more forgiving than other survivors. After all, when you screw up, you hope others will allow you the same luxury of learning from your mistakes.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Spirited:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** Mental malaise doesn’t affect you like it does others. You are trained in Intellect defense tasks.

**Shrug Off Disappointment:** When you fail at a noncombat task and try that task again the very next round, you can apply a free level of Effort toward the success of that task. This benefit effectively alleviates the requirement to apply a level of Effort when retrying failed tasks, at least the first time you retry. Enabler.

**Inability:** You have a lightness of being, but you really feel it when you’re physically challenged. Might defense tasks are hindered.

**Inability:** You’re spirited but not fast. All movement-related tasks are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  The PCs were in a bad spot, and one of the other PCs asked you along to add some perspective.
2.  You had a spot of bad luck, but you jumped back in to try something new, hopeful it would work out.
3.  To make good on a promise to help, you came with the other PCs.
4.  You answered a cry for help when another PC got in over their head.

#### Mutant

Savage forces strong enough to destroy a world left you transformed. Either through latent mutations passed down from ancestors that survived the apocalypse, or because something about you reacts when you’re exposed to radiation or some other mutagenic source, you are prone to mutation. You might look relatively similar to others of your species, or you might have one or more obvious physical differences that make it hard to disguise your nature. Not that you necessarily want to hide what you are; you might wish to proudly display what makes you different and, to your mind, better.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Significant Mutations:** Choose which option from the following list you’d like for your mutations. Whichever you choose, it is rolled for randomly; you don’t select it.
*   Two beneficial mutations rolled randomly.
*   Three beneficial mutations plus one harmful mutation, all rolled randomly
*   One powerful mutation and one harmful mutation, both rolled randomly.
*   One beneficial mutation, one distinctive mutation, and one harmful mutation, all rolled randomly.

**Distinctive Mutations:** You can choose if you want to have distinctive mutations or not. If you do, choose the number, up to four distinctive mutations, which are rolled for randomly. (If the GM is using the transitory mutations optional rule, you can only choose to have up to three distinctive mutations.)

**Cosmetic Mutations:** You can choose if you want to have cosmetic mutations or not. If you do, choose whether you want one or two cosmetic mutations, which are rolled for randomly. Once all your mutations have been rolled for, work together with the GM to ensure that what’s been rolled is a character you want to play.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  The other PCs found you in some weird “mutant” chrysalis and pulled you out; you were grateful and joined them.
2.  The other PCs were “hunting mutants” but when they found you, they realized they had been misguided.
3.  You wanted to get away from a bad situation, so you went with the PCs.
4.  The PCs asked you to come along, believing that your particular mutations could be harnessed for the benefit of the mission.

#### Rusted

Life has dealt you some hard knocks. You lost an eye, an arm, or a leg several years ago, possibly during the apocalypse itself, or perhaps afterward. But you didn’t give up. You adjusted, learning to do everything again, despite what first seemed like a limitation. If you lost a limb, you use a prosthetic; if an eye, you sometimes quip that binocular vision is overrated. Sure, there are times when you struggle with discomfort, pain, and possibly even self-consciousness. However, overcoming all that only makes you stronger and more determined to succeed. Ultimately, your scars, your prosthetic (if any), and your story represent who you are: a survivor who overcomes whatever is thrown your way.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Resilient:** +2 to your Might Pool or +2 to your Intellect Pool or +1 to all three Pools.

**Skill:** Hard knocks have toughened you; you are trained in either Might defense tasks or Intellect defense tasks (choose one).

**Skill:** You had to fake it until you made it; you are trained in one creative skill such as singing, writing, acting, composing, public speaking, painting, sculpture, dancing, or something similar.

**Inability:** You’ve learned to do everything again and, in truth, better than most people ever could. But your injury is real; it’s why you sometimes joke that you’re “rusted.” If you’ve lost an eye, your perception tasks involving sight are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic leg, tasks requiring movement are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic arm, tasks involving using both hands are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a prosthetic for one arm or one leg, or you have an eyepatch (and prosthetic eye) for a missing eye.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  You bragged that there’s nothing someone else could do that you couldn’t do twice as well, which is how you got involved in your current situation.
2.  You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.
3.  You were tailing one of the other PCs for reasons of your own, which brought you into the action.
4.  You stepped in to defend one of the PCs when that character was threatened. While talking to them afterward, you heard about the group’s task.

#### Shiny

You’re brash and bright, and you exult in situations, people, and objects that seem to you as if they have a similar sheen. Literally shiny objects qualify, as well as objects that are not rusted or degraded by time’s passage or the effects of the apocalypse. You also tend to fall into the orbit of people who are strong, unbeaten, and possessed of an inner brightness. You believe that they, like you, reflect the light of some greater spiritual purpose in the world. When you believe you are acting in that glow, you are emboldened and may take risks others fear. You don’t seek death, but you’re confident that death in the pursuit of something shiny is the definition of a life well-lived.

**You gain the following characteristics:**

**Lithe:** +2 to your Speed Pool.

**Skill:** You’ve had practice driving a before-times vehicle. Choose a motorcycle, car or truck, or long-haul truck; you’re trained in driving that kind of vehicle.

**Skill:** You know how to get out of the way. You are trained in Speed defense tasks.

**Shiny Maneuver:** You know how to push yourself harder, at the risk of a more dramatic failure. When you attempt a shiny maneuver, you ease a task, attack roll, or defense roll, but in doing so you increase the intrusion range by two for that roll, to a 1–3 on a d20. If you fail and decide to retry the task (requiring that you spend a level of Effort, as normal), it has the same increased intrusion range. Once you attempt a shiny maneuver, you can’t attempt another until you make a recovery roll. Enabler.

**Inability:** You may be lithe and shiny, but you’re not sneaky. Tasks related to sneaking and staying quiet are hindered.

**Inability:** You are irrepressible, but that makes it hard to dissemble. Deception and disguise tasks are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a treasured object that is literally shiny in bright light, such as a polished stainless-steel sphere, a silver coin, a pocket watch from the before-times, or something else small and easily carried.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1.  It seemed like there were equal odds that the other PCs wouldn’t succeed, which sounded good to you.
2.  The first word that popped into your head upon seeing the PCs was “shiny.”
3.  You think the tasks ahead will present you with unique and fulfilling challenges.
4.  Someone you trust and respect above all others suggested you join the PCs to help them complete their task.

The Scavenges focus can be used as written in the Cypher System Rulebook, but whenever the abilities point to the scavenging rules and tables from the rulebook (including Ruin Lore, Junkmonger, Know Where to Look, and other abilities), use the optional rule for scavenging, repairing, and building in this book instead.

### Foci

This section presents new post-apocalyptic foci that can be used as-is in most games set after civilization falls. As these were created specifically for the post-apocalyptic genre, each has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for other genres).

#### Merges Mind With Machine

You were raised in an underground bunker by Milly, an AI instance installed in your brain before you developed cognition of your own. Unlike AI zombies, your personality and motivations haven’t been replaced; your sense of self grew alongside the AI, as collaborators rather than foes. This granted you superior intellect and an uncanny knack for computers. Now you’ve emerged into the larger world, where survivors are predisposed to distrust you, and you may need to keep your background a secret to be accepted. Whether you hate AI or remain loyal to Milly, you face the best odds if you can fit in with another group of survivors. After all, there’s a lot you don’t know about how things work on the surface and the things people have done to stay alive in the past twenty years.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1.  Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities, and that it might lead to problems.
2.  Pick one other PC. You’re not sure how or from where, but that character has access to rare machine parts and can get them for you at half price.
3.  Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities triggers unpleasant memories for that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.
4.  Pick one other PC. They are sensitive to your focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazed for a few rounds, hindering their actions.

**Additional Equipment:** You have scars on your scalp in the shape of circuitry (like Lichtenberg figures). You probably keep these hidden, as they identify you as one of Milly’s children to anyone familiar with the mark.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You restore 2 points to your Intellect Pool.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** An ally or indicated target can take an additional action.

**Tier 1:** Interface
**Tier 2:** Robot Assistant
**Tier 3:** Ability Choice: Choose either Assisted Sight or Machine Telepathy as your tier 3 ability.
**Assisted Sight (3 Intellect points):** You can activate a visual overlay that helps you analyze threats and boons in your environment. When you trigger this ability, you gain an asset on one attack or defense roll of any type, due to your knowledge about the situation. Enabler.
**Machine Telepathy**
**Tier 4:** Machine Bond
**Network Tap**
**Tier 5:** Greater Enhanced Intellect
**Tier 6:** Ability Choice: Choose either Master Machine or See the Future as your tier 6 ability.
**Master Machine**
**See the Future**

Merges Mind With Machine is a focus designed for use with the Radio Quiet setting.

#### Prepped for the End

You prepared for ultimate disaster, unlike most of the sheeple. Which means you stashed away food, water, and other survival gear when things were still okay. You trained yourself for harsh conditions, for basic machine and electronic repair, and maybe even in a musical instrument to pass the time in the bunker when no other entertainments could be had. You’d excel in a small group of other survivors, but you’re ready to go it alone if that’s what it takes. Above all, you’re prepared to make it through whatever the future holds, no matter how daunting the odds. Because you prepped wisely.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1.  Pick one other PC. You found them in your prepped hideout, eating and drinking their fill. You befriended them rather than seeking revenge for using your resources.
2.  Pick one other PC. You used to play card games with them before the apocalypse, and you still owe them money, though what that means now is difficult to say.
3.  Pick one other PC. This character doesn’t seem to want any of your stored food or water.
4.  Pick one other PC. When you were hurt, they carried you to your prepped hideout at great risk to themselves.

**Additional Equipment:** A firearm of your choice (with ten bullets or shells), a handloading tool set, and a small musical instrument (such as a harmonica).

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Your foe slips in some decaying garbage or spill from the before‑times, and their actions in the next round are hindered as they regain their balance.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You find or spy an item from the Useful Stuff table.

**Tier 1: Practiced in Light Armor:** You can wear light armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing light armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing light armor by 1. You start the game with a type of light armor available in the area, such as a leather jacket. Enabler.

**Prepared Caches:** You have a prepped secret hideout with shelter and basic supplies capable of seeing you through a year or more, or up to six people through about three months. In addition, you have knowledge of three different secret supply caches you put together and hid before everything fell apart, chosen from the following. The caches are located no closer than about 5 miles (8 km) from each other.
*   Food cache (enough food for six people for twelve weeks)
*   Water cache (enough clean water for six people for twelve weeks)
*   Ammunition cache (400 shells or bullets for four different weapons)
*   Firearm cache (six firearms; a mix of light, medium, and heavy weapons, each usually found with about ten bullets or shells)

Enabler.

**Trained for Toughing It:** Choose one noncombat skill that would be helpful for surviving after the apocalypse, such as hunting, tracking, carpentry, or stealth. You are trained in that skill. Enabler.

**Tier 2:** Tinker
**Weather the Vicissitudes**

**Tier 3:** Ability Choice: Choose either Fruitfully Pass the Time or Stashed Vehicle as your tier 3 ability.
**Fruitfully Pass the Time (4 Intellect points):** You are trained in one performance skill, such as singing; playing a fiddle, harmonica, or other instrument; or something else that others would enjoy watching or hearing you do. When you perform with the skill gained through this ability for one minute and you succeed on a difficulty 3 performance roll, you and all allies within short range who can hear and see you immediately gain a one‑action recovery roll. You can’t use this on someone again until you use a one‑hour or ten‑hour recovery roll. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.
**Stashed Vehicle:** You track down where you or a fellow prepper stashed a vehicle, pristinely stored to remain in working order with minimal repairs required. The vehicle has a viable power source (such as hundreds of gallons of gasoline treated to resist decomposition, or a rechargeable battery with options for solar or wind recharging). The vehicle could be an all‑terrain vehicle (ATV), a truck, or something else; work with your GM to figure out the particulars. Enabler

**Tier 4: Know Where to Look:** Whenever the GM obtains a result for you on the Useful Stuff table, you get two results instead of one. If the GM is using some other method to generate rewards for finding valuables, you gain double the result you would otherwise obtain. Enabler.

**Tier 5:** Ambusher

**Tier 6:** Ability Choice: Choose either Discipline of Watchfulness or Escape the Ruins as your tier 6 ability.
**Discipline of Watchfulness**
**Escape the Ruins (6 Intellect points):** While in any area containing ruins from before the apocalypse, you find or create a significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an Intellect action whose difficulty is set by the GM based on the situation. You and the GM should work out the details. Action.

#### Raids

When civilization fell, you did what you had to do to stay alive. Did you kill innocent people? Probably, insofar as anyone who survived the end can really be considered “innocent.” You figured they’d have done the same to you. But whether they deserved it or not, you and the other raiders you ran with survived, and your targets did not. Then something life‑changing happened to you, altering your perspective; it’s up to you to decide what. In any case, you’ve turned over a new leaf. You don’t indiscriminately kill anymore, though surviving is still a goal. But you’ve joined with others who you want to protect as much as or even more than your own life. You’re done with raiding. But is raiding (and those who might recognize you as a raider) done with you?

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1.  Pick one other PC. That character knows that you were a raider, even though it is a secret you’ve kept from the other PCs so far.
2.  Pick one other PC. They were also a raider, however briefly, along with you (if they agree to this connection).
3.  Pick one other PC. You feel very protective of this character and don’t want to see them harmed.
4.  Pick one other PC. You know that you’re responsible for the death of someone that character knew while you were raiding; they don’t know it, but the guilt has been waking you up in the middle of the night.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a tattoo from your raiding days that you probably keep hidden, as it would identify you as a raider to those familiar with the mark.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You restore 2 points to your Might Pool.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You or an ally get an immediate extra attack.

**Tier 1:** Ignore the Pain
**Wilderness Life**

**Tier 2: Careful Tracker:** You are trained in stealth and tracking tasks. Enabler.
**Fearsome Reputation**

**Tier 3:** Ability Choice: Choose either Raider Follower or Grand Deception as your tier 3 ability.
**Raider Follower:** You gain a level 3 follower (initiative, stealth, and defense as level 4). The follower does as you say and, generally speaking, isn’t someone who makes the other PCs in your group feel uncomfortable because of their presence. Enabler.

**Grand Deception**

**Tier 4:** Greater Frenzy

**Tier 5:** Using the Environment

**Tier 6:** Ability Choice: Choose either Deep Consideration or Twisting the Knife as your tier 6 ability.
**Deep Consideration**
**Twisting the Knife**

#### Remembers the Past

You are a student of the before‑times. Maybe that’s because you grew up in the ruins of an old library and read everything as your hobby, you found a friendly AI archivist who taught you about how things once were, you’re long‑lived and were alive before the apocalypse, or you have a deep recollection of the world before the end for some other reason. This knowledge gives you an appreciation of the before‑times as well as a point of view that many other survivors lack that benefits you in and around ruins. You can find things others wouldn’t know to look for, plucking fruits of the past that would otherwise go unharvested.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1.  Pick one other PC. They remind you of someone you knew or learned about from the past, because of either the way they look or the way they act, and that is what first drew you to them.
2.  Pick one other PC. You saved their life because you found them trapped in a before‑times ruin and you knew how best to free them.
3.  Pick one other PC. You were lost out past the ruins in the wilderness, but they happened across you and saved your life.
4.  Pick one other PC. This character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children.

**Additional Equipment:** One book on a technical topic such as plumbing, carpentry, electronics, or physics; it provides you an asset on a related task if you spend ten minutes perusing the book ahead of time.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You remember something about the area that proves advantageous later, such as realizing there’s probably a fresh location to scavenge close by that has a good chance of not having been picked over by other survivors.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** A foe forgets about you unless you draw attention to yourself.

**Tier 1: Ruin Lore:** You are trained in scavenging, which means you’re more likely to find useful things (and junk that can potentially be turned into useful things) in the ruins of what came before. Enabler.
**Knowledge Skills**

**Tier 2: Fixer:** You’ve learned enough of the past that you are trained in tasks to repair and build before‑times equipment, or equipment made with before‑times parts. In addition, repairing and building tasks take you about 20% less time to complete. Enabler.
**Know the Way:** You are familiar with before‑times buildings and other structures, which extends to ruins of the same. You are trained in tasks related to getting around inside those buildings quickly, finding alternate routes, finding places to hide, and other tasks associated with gaining a benefit by being able to picture a likely floor plan of any given building. Enabler.

**Tier 3:** Ability Choice: Choose either Disable Mechanisms or Resource Seeker as your tier 3 ability.
**Disable Mechanisms**
**Resource Seeker (3+ Intellect points):** When you are looking for a specific inexpensive item you’d like to scavenge from nearby ruins, such as a candle, an aspirin, or a can of preserved chili, you can focus your attention on it so that you are more likely to find it. For the next ten minutes, if what you are seeking is within long range, you find it if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect roll. Each time you use this ability again in the same area, the difficulty is hindered by one additional step. For each level of Effort you apply, you can attempt to find an object of one higher expense category, but the base difficulty of the Intellect roll also increases by 1 per higher expense category. Action to initiate.

**Tier 4:** Improvise

**Tier 5:** Task Specialization

**Tier 6:** Ability Choice: Choose either Skill With Attacks, Skill With Defense, or Use the Network as your tier 6 ability.
**Skill With Attacks**
**Skill With Defense**
**Use the Network (5 Intellect points):** With a few minutes of looking around and preparing, you can access remnants of the before‑times internet and satellite network (or an active network on which AIs who are not immediately dangerous reside). The GM may decide there is no such connection in the area, but if there is, you can ask one basic question about anything happening within 10 miles (16 km) and receive a simple answer. For example, you could ask about the location of a specific creature or individual, and if they are within the range of this ability, you’ll learn about it from a still‑functioning camera feed, satellite feed, or AI interaction. Action to initiate.

#### Walks the Wasteland

Most people want to hide from the devastation or just curl up and die rather than face a hostile world. Not you. You’re determined to see what’s out there, to survive, and, more than that, to thrive. It’s that or let the radioactive rats—or whatever it is that hunts the ruins—get you. If you were around before the end, you could have been a soldier, mercenary, or at least someone who had basic survival training. What sets you apart from all the others like you is that you decided to hope when everything looked darkest. Since then, you have eaten your share of spoiled food and irradiated water, and survived. Whether that’s because you’ve adapted, you’re luckier, or you were just tougher than the rest is anyone’s guess. But you’re still walking the wastes even though so many others are gone. You probably don’t spend a lot of time on your appearance, given that you wear the cobbled‑together clothing and bits and pieces of armor you’re able to scavenge from the ruins. Appearance doesn’t matter; actions do.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1.  Pick one other PC. This character appears to be an able survivor, but in your mind, they seem to be at the end of their rope. You’re constantly trying to convince them to keep trying, go the distance, and survive for a better tomorrow.
2.  Pick one other PC. You feel very protective of this character and don’t want to see them harmed.
3.  Pick one other PC. This character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children. Whether that place exists any longer is something you and that character should decide.
4.  Pick one other PC. You found this character almost dead in the wastes. You rescued them, nursed them back to health, and kept them safe until they were back on their feet. Whether they feel embarrassment, gratitude, or something else is up to them.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a piece of before‑times equipment with three analog dials that measure temperature, air pressure, and humidity. (You also know the names for the instruments nestled behind those dials: a thermometer, a barometer, and a hygrometer, respectively.) If you spend a minute operating the device, you have an asset on weather prediction tasks extending into the next day.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You restore 2 points to your Might Pool.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** Your next action is eased by two steps.

**Tier 1: Surviving the Wasteland:** Given about half a day of walking and scavenging, you find enough edible food and potable water in the ruins or surrounding wasteland for you and up to one other person for one day. The resources might be scavenged from before‑times supplies, living flora and fauna, and uncontaminated water sources. Enabler.
**Tolerance:** This hard life has built up your resistance over time, so you are trained in resisting the effects of natural poisons (such as those from plants or living creatures) and radiation. You’re also immune to natural diseases. Enabler.
**Weapon at Hand:** You’re practiced with all weapons. To gain this benefit with a weapon you’ve never used before, you must spend at least ten minutes practicing with it first. Enabler.

**Tier 2: Devoted Defender**
**Hardened by the End:** You’re trained in Might defense tasks.

**Tier 3:** Ability Choice: Choose either Hard to Hit or Rapid Attack as your tier 3 ability. Whatever you choose, you also gain Apocalyptic Stare.
**Hard to Hit**
**Rapid Attack**
**Apocalyptic Stare:** Your demeanor is of someone who shouldn’t be trifled with. You are trained in intimidation. Enabler.

**Tier 4: Improved Recovery**
**Push on Through**

**Tier 5: Ignore the Pain**

**Tier 6:** Ability Choice: Choose either Using What’s Available or Wasteland Camouflage as your tier 6 ability.
**Using What’s Available**
**Wasteland Camouflage (5+ Speed or Intellect points):** By drawing your clothing about you just so and using various tricks and your deep knowledge of your surroundings, you become invisible for ten minutes in any landscape that contains ruins of the before‑times. (You may also attempt this in a purely wilderness setting, but if you do, you must spend 1 additional point from Speed or Intellect, whichever Pool you activated this power with.) While you are invisible, this asset eases your stealth and Speed defense tasks by two steps. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.

### Additional Post-Apocalyptic Species Descriptors
In a post-apocalyptic setting, some GMs may want to offer species affected by the disaster.

-----

### Morlock

You have lived your life deep underground in artificial bunkers, hidden from the world's destruction and the brutal scavengers that live above. As a morlock, you have a keen mind for the technology salvaged from the before-time. In fact, every morlock comes of age by fitting a piece of morlock technology to its body to provide enhancement and extend its life. This means that you are part flesh and part machine. Your skin is as pale as milk, except where it's been replaced with strips of metal and glowing circuits.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Enhanced Intelligence**: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Cyborg Body**: +2 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.

**Partially Metallic**: +1 to Armor.

**Repair and Maintenance**: As an entity of living flesh and humming machinery, you must first succeed on a difficulty 2 repair task before making a recovery roll. On a failure, the recovery roll is not used; however, the normal rules for retrying apply, and you must use Effort on a new roll if you wish to try again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to heal additional points to your Pools (each level of Effort healing an additional 2 points to your Pools if you succeed).

**Morlock Prejudice**: While among non-morlocks, all positive interaction tasks are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. The PCs found you in a collapsed subterranean tunnel.
2. The other PCs encountered you exploring underground, and you convinced them to allow you to accompany them.
3. You were exiled from the morlock communities and needed help on the surface.
4. The only way to save the morlock community you hail from is to venture to the surface and find a mechanical part needed to repair a failing ancient system.

-----

### Roach

You are born of a species of evolved insects once called "cockroach," but that is far in the past. Radiation and forced evolution have radically increased your size, shape, and ability to think. Your exoskeleton mimics the shape of a human being, though not perfectly. When you move about human society, shadows and cloaks are your ally if you wish to pass unnoticed. When those of your kind are discovered, it usually goes poorly for someone. You, however, have a wandering spirit and seek to explore the fallen world and find a new way forward.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Scuttler**: Your Speed Edge increases by 1.

**Sense by Scent**: You can sense your environment even in total darkness.

**Cling**: You can move an immediate distance each round on walls or clinging to the ceiling.

**Carapace**: +1 to Armor.

**Glide**: You can extend small wings from your carapace that grant an asset in jumping tasks and allow you to fall up to a short distance without taking damage.

**Skill**: You are trained in disguise tasks.

**Inability**: You are susceptible to disease and poison. Defense rolls against disease or poison are hindered.

**Inability**: You mimic a human, but you are not as fierce. Tasks involving combat--- including attack and defense rolls---are hindered.

**Insect Prejudice**: While among non-roaches, all positive interaction tasks are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure**: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. The PCs didn't realize what you were when they asked for your help.
2. You've managed to hide your roach ancestry so well that everyone thinks you are like them.
3. You are the last of your kind.
4. You have a secret agenda, and the PCs were gullible enough to let you come along.

## Scavenging

Characters in a post-apocalyptic setting must usually spend part of each day scavenging for supplies or a place of safety.

**Food and Shelter**: Generally speaking, characters must spend two to four hours searching through the rubble and ruins before succeeding. Finding enough food for a group of characters to eat for one day is a difficulty 5 Intellect task. Finding a place of relative safety to regroup and rest is also difficulty 5. Characters who succeed on either one of these also get to roll up to once each day on the Useful Stuff table and three times on the Junk table.

Found food often takes the form of canned, processed, dried, or otherwise preserved goods from before the apocalypse, but sometimes it includes fresh fruits and vegetables found growing wild or cultivated by other survivors. Safe places to hole up include homes, RVs, offices, apartments, or any location that can be secured and defended and isn't radioactive, poisoned, or overrun with hostile creatures.

The difficulty of succeeding at finding food, water, and a safe place varies by location and by how many days the characters have already spent in one location. Each week the PCs spend at the same location hinders subsequent scavenging tasks and requires that they succeed on a new task to determine if the place they're staying is still safe. The result of failing to find food and water is obvious. If the PCs fail at the task of finding (or keeping) a safe place, their presence is noticed by hostile forces, or they face a result from the Wasteland Threats table.

**Useful Stuff**: Food, water, and a safe place to rest are the most important finds, and are the basis of each scavenging task. But other obviously useful stuff is often found along with these basic requirements. When a group of characters successfully finds either food and water or a safe place, consult the Useful Stuff table up to once per day. If it's the first day the PCs have searched in a particular area, each character might find something useful, but in succeeding days, a group normally gets only a single roll to find useful stuff.

Useful stuff also includes a "loot" entry. Loot includes collectible coins from before the apocalypse, such as silver dollars and gold eagles. It also includes jewelry and artwork that survived the disaster and related material that can be used as currency or barter when the characters find other survivors or arrive at a trade town.

Items found on the Useful Stuff table are generally expensive or exorbitant items (except for firearms, which start in the expensive category).

**Junk**: Characters who find food and water also find lots of junk. They are free to ignore that junk, but some PCs might have a use for what they find, especially those with the Scavenges focus. All characters gain up to three results on the Junk table each time they successfully scavenge for food or a safe place to stay. Sometimes junk can be fixed, but more often it can be disassembled and used as parts to create something else.

## Post-Apocalyptic Cyphers and Artifacts

### Post-Apocalyptic Cyphers

#### Subtle Cyphers

Subtle cyphers are appropriate if your game’s pre‑apocalyptic world was realistic (like our modern world) right up until it was destroyed and if the disaster was a realistic cataclysm (like a pandemic, climate disaster, or war).

**Optional Rule: Transferring Subtle Cyphers**

A PC with a subtle cypher can use it on an ally they can touch and speak with as their action instead of gaining the effect themself. They manage this feat by motivating the recipient through speech and interaction, effectively inspiring the recipient in the same way the subtle cypher would have affected the character with the cypher. This uses the action of the character activating the cypher, not the recipient.

#### Manifest Cyphers

Manifest cyphers in a post‑apocalyptic game might be remnants of the technology or magic that civilization used before it fell, or the technology or magic that caused the end of the world.

### Scavenger Subtle Cyphers

Resource scarcity, including lack of water and food, threatens PCs in most post‑apocalyptic settings. Enter scavenger subtle cyphers. These give PCs one more way to find useful stuff like edible food, clean water, a helpful tool, extra ammo, or other needful things.

**Discovering Scavenger Subtle Cyphers:** Anytime PCs in your game are eligible for discovering a subtle cypher, consider giving someone in the group a scavenger subtle cypher. No more than one PC in the group should have a scavenger subtle cypher at any given time. Once they use it, you can give another PC in the group one, preferably something different.

**Using a Scavenger Subtle Cypher:** The character uses their action to activate the scavenger subtle cypher, as usual. At the end of their turn, they gain the indicated resource.

### Additional Post-Apocalyptic Manifest Cyphers

Manifest cyphers are sometimes found in the ruins of Radio Quiet. One variety PCs might discover are AI‑fashioned. When activated, the cypher dematerializes, swirling out into a cloud of free‑floating tiny machines that create the cypher’s effect through direct manipulation before burning out or dispersing.

**Effect:** AI‑fashioned cyphers can provide nearly any effect described for cyphers in the Cypher System Rulebook, as well as the effects described for the new manifest cyphers in the following section.

**Secondary Effect:** Any time an AI‑fashioned manifest cypher is used, there’s a chance the AI who created it for their own ambiguous purpose becomes aware, if that instance still operates somewhere. That usually has no bearing on the situation, but if the PC triggers an intrusion while using the cypher, a fledgling instance of the AI tries to install on the PC, who must succeed on an Intellect defense roll against the cypher’s level to avoid coming under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.

#### AI-Fashioned Manifest Cyphers

| D10 | Cypher |
|---|---|
| 1 | AI instance |
| 2 | Armor breach |
| 3 | Data wipe |
| 4 | Denature nanotech |
| 5 | Detonation (prion) |
| 6 | Disassembler |
| 7 | Disassembler, ephemeral |
| 8 | Fabricator, civil |
| 9 | Fabricator, military |
| 10 | Smartdust |

**AI INSTANCE**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Effect:** Installs an AI instance in an inert object. The instance persists for about a day. The AI’s level is equal to this cypher's level. The AI has the ability to understand and audibly synthesize nearly any language and can provide answers to questions. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the higher its level. The instance can only answer questions equal to its level or less. Generally, knowledge that could be found by looking somewhere other than the current location is level 1 or higher, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. If the AI answers a question of level 5 or higher, the instance’s existence terminates. Alternatively, the AI can be used to engage another AI in the area, distracting it from taking direct actions for a number of minutes equal to this cypher’s level. After this interval, the instance’s existence terminates.

**ARMOR BREACH**
**Level:** 1d6
**Effect:** A successfully targeted creature or object within short range becomes coated with a clinging film of nanotech for one minute. While coated, a creature has 2 less Armor than usual (3 less if the cypher is level 5 or 6). While coated, an object temporarily moves one step down the object damage track (or two steps down if the cypher is level 5 or 6).

**DATA WIPE**
**Level:** 1d6 + 2
**Effect:** A successfully targeted AI instance within short range whose level is equal to or less than this cypher’s level is suppressed and unable to function for one minute. If this cypher’s level is 7 or higher, a success means the instance is permanently wiped from the hardware (or wetware, if installed on a living creature).

**DENATURE NANOTECH**
**Level:** 1d6 + 3
**Effect:** Coats a short area surrounding the user, or adjacent to the user, with a nearly invisible film of nanotech that lasts for years. The first time anyone attempts to use a nanotech‑based cypher, ability, or other effect in the affected area whose level is less than this cypher’s level, that use is suppressed and fails. Once one effect is suppressed, the denaturing effect is expended. The cypher instead can be used to end one ongoing nanotech effect of the cypher’s level or less in a short area, but the user must succeed on an Intellect attack roll against the level of the effect or the target creating the effect. For instance, if this cypher is successfully used against a creature genetically engineered by nanotech, the creature would become so much inert biological matter.

**DETONATION (PRION)**
**Level:** 1d6 + 2
**Effect:** Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away that bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level. On a hit, the living tissue of targets whose level is less than the cypher’s level begins to unravel due to a prion‑unfolding chain reaction. These targets take damage equal to the cypher’s level on the first round, then 1 point of damage each subsequent round until only so much cloudy pink fluid remains. PCs can make a Might defense roll each round to end the effect; two successful defense rolls end the chain reaction. NPCs whose level is equal to or higher than the cypher’s level take damage from the cypher for only one round.

**DISASSEMBLER**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Effect:** Recycles waste or other unwanted material by breaking it down to constituent atoms and molecules. If used destructively, this cypher can disassemble an object within immediate range whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s level that fits into a 10‑foot (3.5 m) cube, or it can create a cavity of the same volume in a larger object whose level is less than the cypher’s level. If used as a weapon against creatures, the cypher can be hurled a short distance like a detonation, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level in an immediate area and reducing the effectiveness of any Armor worn by targets by 1.

**DISASSEMBLER, EPHEMERAL**
**Level:** 1d6 + 2
**Effect:** An object or creature whose level is equal to or less than this cypher’s level within immediate range is temporarily disassembled into its component atoms and molecules. The disassembly lasts for up to ten hours or until a time specified by the user, whichever occurs first. When the effect ends, the object or creature is reassembled over the course of one round at the location where it was disassembled (or at the location the fine “dust” of its disassembly was moved to). A Speed attack roll is necessary to affect an unwilling target. PCs can make a Might defense roll to resist being disassembled.

**FABRICATOR, CIVIL**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Effect:** Assembles a specified object whose level is equal to the cypher’s level. Once created, the object is permanent until destroyed. A civil fabricator can build one object on the Additional Post‑Apocalyptic Equipment table (or another equipment table in the Cypher System Rulebook) that falls into the “other items” category—no weapons or armor. The user chooses which item to fabricate by speaking aloud the name of the item they want as they activate the cypher. The higher the cypher level, the more expensive an item the fabricator can create, as follows: Level 2 cyphers can fabricate inexpensive items, cyphers of level 3 or less can fab inexpensive and moderately priced items, cyphers of level 6 or less can fab up to expensive items, and level 7 cyphers can fab up to very expensive items.

A civil fabricator can create appropriately priced food items. However, it can’t fabricate living creatures.

**FABRICATOR, MILITARY**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Effect:** A military fabricator cypher functions like a civil fabricator; however, it can be used to create armor or weapons. If a weapon that uses ammunition is fabricated, the weapon’s magazine holds up to ten rounds of fabbed ammunition.

**SMARTDUST**
**Level:** 1d6 + 2
**Effect:** Coats an area up to a short distance in diameter with a nearly invisible film of nanotech that lasts for a number of months equal to the cypher’s level. Afterward, the user can see, hear, smell, and feel the vibrations of any activity that occurs in that location no matter how far they are from it.

### Pre-Apocalyptic Artifacts

One interesting approach for artifacts in a post‑apocalyptic setting is to use before‑times items that were once commonplace—such as books, functioning vehicles, and portable water filters, among many other items—but are now nearly impossible to manufacture and hard to preserve. The depletion roll for such items represents the likelihood that the item will fall apart, break down, or run out. The upshot of adopting such a system for your game is that nearly every nonfood item on the Useful Stuff table is also a pre‑apocalyptic artifact. Give most of these items a depletion of 1 in 1d20; however, if the item seems particularly hardy, a roll of 1d100 is appropriate. If particularly flimsy or prone to being used up, a depletion of 1d10 or 1d6 would be in order. Refer to the following examples as a guide for adapting before‑times Useful Stuff objects into artifacts with a specific depletion.

**Book**
**Level:** 1d6
**Form:** Textbook, how‑to book, or other nonfiction book of knowledge on one topic; may be moldy or otherwise damaged
**Effect:** This book covers a particular topic or area of knowledge determined by the GM. A reader who studies it for an hour has an asset on a related Intellect task.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d100

**Faraday Cage**
**Level:** 3
**Form:** Container made of metal mesh, of variable size (usually up to the size of a room)
**Effect:** Blocks electromagnetic signals from reaching the interior of the cage.
**Depletion:** —

**Salvaged Car**
**Level:** 1d6
**Form:** Rusted vehicle, with parts cobbled together from multiple before‑times vehicles
**Effect:** Transports five characters a very long distance on each turn in an open cab or, if level 6, a closed cab.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each time the engine is started or the car begins a trip)

**Water Filter**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Form:** Large pitcher with built‑in filter
**Effect:** Purifies enough drinking water for one character per artifact level every day.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each day used)

### Post-Apocalyptic Artifacts

The kinds of post‑apocalyptic artifacts described in the Cypher System Rulebook are, for the most part, retro‑futuristic, or at least manifest cyphers created by super‑science that is mostly beyond today’s technology. Most of these would fit in almost any post‑apocalyptic setting that includes fantastic elements, especially if reskinned to be thematically appropriate. The artifacts presented below include artifacts appropriate to an End Times apocalypse, an apocalypse caused by the rise of antagonistic AIs (such as in Radio Quiet), and alien tech possibly brought by invading or terraforming aliens. That said, any artifact could potentially be the result of AI artifice. Such artifacts usually have a fractal quality to their form, as is the case for AI‑fashioned cyphers. And like AI‑fashioned cyphers, a triggered intrusion could endanger the user if an instance of the artificial intelligence that created the item tries to install itself on the PC’s wetware (mind).

| D20 | Apocalypse | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Retro-futuristic | Autodoc\* |
| 3-4 | Alien | Carbonizer |
| 5-6 | Retro-futuristic | Enviroscanner\* |
| 7 | Alien or AI-fashioned | Memory Eraser |
| 8 | Retro-futuristic | Military exoskeleton\* |
| 9 | AI-fashioned | Mutation Inducer |
| 10-12 | AI-fashioned | Nanorifle |
| 13 | Retro-futuristic | Rocket fist\* |
| 14-16 | Retro-futuristic | Rocket-propelled grenade |
| 17 | End Times | Seal of Solomon |
| 18 | End Times | Spear of Destiny |
| 19 | Retro-futuristic | Terahertz scanner\* |
| 20 | Alien | Transfer discs |

\*Artifacts presented in the Cypher System Rulebook

**Autodoc**

**Level**: 1d6

**Form**: Backpack-sized plastic module from which clamps, forceps, scalpels, and needles can extend

**Effect**: When strapped to a target (or when someone wearing the autodoc is damaged), the autodoc activates and restores 1 point to a target's Pools each round for ten rounds or until the target is fully healed, whichever happens first.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d10


**Enviroscanner**

**Level**: 1d6

**Form**: Forearm-mounted computer tablet

**Effect**: This multifunction device can receive radio transmissions, automatically map locations the wearer has visited, play various forms of media, keep voice and written records, and provide an asset to any task related to interfacing with other computerized systems or machines. Also, the wearer can scan for specific materials, toxic traces, and life forms within short range.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d10 (check per use of scanning function)


**Military Exoskeleton**

**Level**: 1d6 + 1

**Form**: Articulated metal struts with deformable padding and straps for custom fit to a human frame

**Effect**: For one hour per use (when the exoskeleton is powered on), the wearer has +1 to their Speed Edge and +1 to their Might Edge.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d10


**Rocket Fist**

**Level**: 1d6 + 2

**Form**: Metal gauntlet with flaring rocket exhaust nozzles

**Effect**: If the user activates the fist as part of an attack, the punch gains a rocket assist. If the attack is successful, the fist inflicts additional damage equal to the artifact level and throws the target back a short distance.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d10


**Rocket-Propelled Grenade**

**Level**: 1d6 + 3

**Form**: Tube with sight and trigger

**Effect**: The user can make a long-range attack with a rocket-propelled grenade that inflicts 7 points of damage to the target and every creature and object next to the target.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d6


**Terahertz Scanner**

**Level**: 1d6 + 1

**Form**: Visor fitted with bulky electronics

**Effect**: By emitting terahertz and long-range infrared light, this device allows a user to see a short distance through most interior walls of standard structures, through normal clothing, and into normal bags and briefcases. Only stone or concrete more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick prevents a scan. Regardless, images are black and white and fuzzy, and lack fine detail.

**Depletion**: 1 in 1d20


**Carbonizer**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Form:** Tiny silver device with multiple prong‑like barrels
**Effect:** This weapon fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact’s level that ignores Armor (including Armor granted by force fields). A target killed by a carbonizer is turned completely to dust.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

**Memory Eraser**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Form:** Handheld reflective mass
**Effect:** A flash of nano‑textured light erases the last few minutes of memory in all creatures within immediate range that the user makes a successful Intellect attack on (one attack roll per target).
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

**Mutation Inducer**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Form:** Handheld reflective device with gradually evolving fractal textures
**Effect:** A targeted willing or helpless creature within immediate range is transformed over the course of one minute, gaining a randomly determined beneficial mutation. If the artifact is level 6 or higher, the target instead gains a powerful mutation. Mutations gained by the inducer fade within about a day.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, target also gains a harmful mutation)

**Nanorifle**
**Level:** 1d6 + 2
**Form:** Sleek two‑handed reflective device with gradually evolving fractal textures
**Effect:** This weapon contains an onboard AI that assists the user, granting an asset to any attacks made with the weapon. The weapon fires a stream of nanomachine rounds at a target within long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact’s level. In addition, if the target fails an Intellect defense roll, they are affected as if with a minor AI instance hazard, coming under the control of the AI housed in the nanorifle rather than a random artificial intelligence. The AI usually works with the user to exert control over the target. Control lasts for about a minute.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d100

**Seal of Solomon**
**Level:** 1d6 + 2
**Form:** Signet ring bearing a star design
**Effect:** The wearer can attempt to command a demon, a devil, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, an angel, or a similar entity by making a successful Intellect attack roll against a target within short range. An affected target must do as requested for up to one minute (if the creature is level 5 or lower) or for one round (if the creature is level 6 or higher). The ring also grants the wearer the ability to understand and communicate with animals.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d100

**Spear of Destiny**
**Level:** 7
**Form:** Heavy spear of ancient manufacture
**Effect:** Attacks with this spear are eased. If used against a supernatural creature such as a demon, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, or an angel, it ignores Armor, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (10 points total). If an attack with the spear kills a target normally able to return to existence (such as a Horseman), the target is truly destroyed instead.
**Depletion:** —
**Spear of Destiny GM intrusion:** The wielder’s heart is not pure enough to permit the use of the spear, and it burns the character for 7 points of ambient damage each round they use it.

**Transfer Discs**
**Level:** 1d6 + 1
**Form:** Two or more matching discs 3 feet (1 m) in diameter
**Effect:** The user can step between deployed transfer discs, teleporting any distance. If a series of discs is deployed in a network, the user receives a mental map of the discs upon stepping on any one of them, and they can navigate by stepping on each intervening disc between their current location and their desired location. To deploy a disc as their action, the user places it on a mostly level, secure surface and must succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect‑based roll.
**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check after each day of use)

## Basic Creatures And NPCs For A Post-Apocalyptic Game

* **Crazy loner**: level 3, deception and attacks as level 5
* **Gamma snake**: level 4; bite inflicts 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor)
* **Innocuous rodent**: level 1
* **Mongrel dog**: level 4
* **Survivor, sickened**: level 3, interaction and knowledge tasks as level 1; carries level 4 infectious disease
* **Survivor, typical**: level 3


## Post-Apocalyptic Creatures and NPCs

The most important element of each creature or NPC is its level. The level is the same as the target number used to determine what a player must roll to attack or defend against that creature. In each entry, the target number for the creature—which is three times the creature’s level—is listed in parentheses after its level. A creature’s target number is usually also its health. Health is the amount of damage the creature can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, the entries always list a creature’s health, even when it’s the normal amount for a creature of its level. For more detailed information on level, health, combat, and other elements, see Understanding the Listings in the Cypher System Rulebook.

### Building More Creatures and NPCs

Those that survived the cataclysm are tougher, or at least luckier. Here are a couple of methods for creating even more creatures and NPCs for your post‑apocalyptic setting than the ones that appear here and in the Cypher System Rulebook.

**Reskin:** One way to create new creatures appropriate for your setting is to grab one from any other Cypher System bestiary and change its description just enough so it works in your game

**Blighted.** Another approach is to apply the Blighted “template” to a regular animal, creature, or person, turning them into a more twisted version of their pre‑apocalypse self.

#### Blighted

A blighted creature or NPC is touched by a mutation and/or a contagion that makes them more dangerous than standard creatures of their type. It is scarred and twisted in some way, and possibly slightly bigger—or at least wirier—than average, which explains why it’s survived so long, even blighted. A blighted creature shows signs of degradation—such as a bacterial, viral, or even mycological infection—tracing disturbing sores, scars, or encrustations across its skin or hide. The specifics are up to you. Many blighted creatures and people are hungry and hurt, acting rabidly. But an NPC could just as easily retain human sentiment despite their deteriorated condition.

**Effect:** Apply the following stat adjustments to a blighted creature.

*   Increase the creature’s level by 1 and increase all its related stats by the appropriate amount (1 more point of average damage, 3 more points of health, and so on).
*   The creature’s perception tasks are hindered by two steps; whatever blights the creature is slowly blinding it.
*   In bright light, the creature’s tasks are hindered. (A blighted human could wear shades to nullify this hindrance; other creatures might come up with similar tactics or stay in shadows when possible.)
*   The creature’s scratches, bites, spittle, or similar attacks contain a contagion known as “the blight.”
    *   **The Blight:** The creature is a contagion vector for the same agent that blights it, whether that’s radiation, bacteria, a virus, mycological spores, or something stranger. Treat the contagion as a disease with a level equal to the blighted creature’s level. The affected creature’s tasks are hindered by one additional step each day a Might defense roll is failed. For each two steps a target is hindered, it also moves one step down the damage track. When a target moves down the third step, either it dies (20% chance) or it survives but gains the Blighted template (80% chance). A blighted creature loses the hindrance described in this paragraph.

### Creatures By Apocalypse

**Any Apocalypse:** Almost any apocalypse will include natural wildlife, like bears, dogs, and rats, as well as various human survivors. Some of those human survivors will become bandits, fell riders, marauders, a few warlords, and probably some cannibals. A few could stalk the wasteland as bounty‑hunting (or revenge‑seeking) assassins.

**Biblical Apocalypse:** In addition to creatures common to any apocalypse, a biblical apocalypse—as described in the End Times set piece— should also include fallen angels, angels, demons, and devils, and of course the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Beast, Sword, Famine, and Plague).

**Nuclear Apocalypse:** Besides creatures common to any apocalypse, it’s possible PCs could run into various radioactive creatures such as fusion hounds, glowing roaches, gamma worms, and radioactive bears, as well as a variety of creatures with the Blighted template.

**AI Apocalypse:** Besides creatures and NPCs common to any apocalypse, PCs might encounter CRAZRs, hooked blossoms, vat rejects, mechanical soldiers, wardroids, and zhev. And, of course, a few instances of artificial intelligence, possibly including AI zombies.

**Alien Apocalypse:** If the world is invaded or terraformed by aliens, creatures and NPCs common to any apocalypse exist, as well as the potential for various aliens such as greys, slidikin, enthrallers, and maybe even a kaiju or two.

**Temporal Apocalypse:** If the barriers between time, space, and dimension break down, ushering in a time rip, any creature and NPC from any genre could be encountered, including supervillains, chronophages, kaiju, killer clowns, killing white lights, and melted.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Angel Of The Apocalypse <---> 7 (21) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
If the End Times causes civilization to fall, biblical threats multiply across the land, including one or more angels of the apocalypse. They are every bit as terrifying as the Four Horsemen because they’re charged with bringing about the end of the world. They have little room for pity or the plights of individuals; they have nations to topple and the forces of Hell to oppose.

Angels of the apocalypse radiate a halo of golden white light. Their 10 foot (3.5 m) tall forms—caparisoned for war—are somewhat humanoid, though each has one or more sets of wings. Apocalypse angels also wield an implement that seems to be equal parts trumpet and sword, which they can sound to bring about terrible events, or swing to slay those who oppose them.

**Motive:** Instigate the biblical apocalypse; fight the forces of Hell
**Environment:** Almost anywhere, usually alone or fighting Hell’s armies
**Health:** 27
**Damage Inflicted:** 8 points
**Armor:** 3
**Movement:** Short; long when flying
**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to size; perception and detecting falsehoods as level 8

**Combat:** The angel of the apocalypse attacks twice each round with their greatsword.

An angel’s halo momentarily brightens with unbearable psychic energy as combat begins; foes within short range are stunned for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense task on their turn to end the effect early. A success means that creature becomes immune to the halo’s overwhelming effect.

The angel can blow their trumpet as their action, creating a blast of sound and energy that sweeps out in all directions to a long distance, inflicting 8 points of damage to all creatures that hear it who fail a Might defense roll, and 2 points even with a successful roll. Structures in the area descend one step on the object damage track. Once they blow their trumpet, they usually can’t blow it again for several rounds.

**Interaction:** Wrapped in purpose, an angel of the apocalypse may ignore entreaties or, if one deigns to respond, tell supplicants to ready themselves for judgment. However, if someone manages to convince an angel to take notice due to their persuasion skill and/or the importance of their need, the angel may give that character aid in the form of healing or direct help immediately or at some promised future date.

**Use:** A high, pure trumpet sounds. All around the characters, structures fall, revealing an angel of the apocalypse overhead.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Artificial Intelligence (Ai) <---> 6 (18) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
An artificial intelligence thinks independently, learning and evolving with experience. AIs have their own goals and motivations, and may work with or against humans. Some want to gather data, some want to solve technological problems, and some want to take over the world—at any cost.

AIs take many forms. Some are distributed across a vast network. Others are isolated in a single computer. A few are machines with organic parts or can use such machines as servitors.

Because AIs are entities of extreme intelligence, they can adapt to new situations. Most AIs act on some kind of plan, whether long acting or concocted to fit the situation at hand.

*When acting from a remote terminal, the AI’s effective level is lowered. It can be as low as level 3, but typically is level 5.

**Motive:** Varies
**Environment:** Almost anywhere
**Health:** 23
**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
**Armor:** 2
**Movement:** None, or instantly to any networked machine able to host them

**Combat:** An electrical discharge—or in some cases precisely pulsed sequences of lights, each designed for a specific creature to see—can affect all targets within short range of the AI (or the AI’s local “terminal”), inflicting damage from electricity (or Intellect damage, which ignores Armor).

An AI may attempt to install an instance of themself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI instance for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.

AIs can control other lower level computer systems and sometimes even nanobots.

Some targets of AI instance installation never recover, becoming AI zombies. Besides AI zombies, an AI may also rely on guardians (such as mechanical soldiers or CRAZRs made to their own design).

Unless the PCs can track a given AI to their original computing core, damage to one may just be damage done to a terminal. Thus, even if an AI is seemingly destroyed, they might exist as another instance somewhere else. However, over time, alternate instances may collect different data and thus develop different memories and motivations.

Some AIs continue to improve themselves by modifying their own code. These AIs are level 8 threats with 27 health, and they can create cyphers and artifacts, which they often deploy in combat.

**Interaction:** Some AIs enjoy negotiation. Others simply ignore humans as unworthy of their time and attention. An AI’s voice often sounds surprisingly human.

**Use:** The PCs’ shelter is overtaken by a storm of grey goo, which answers to an AI operating out of a nearby safehouse.

**Loot:** An AI may have access to 1d6 cyphers and two or three artifacts.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Cannibal <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Cannibals come in a variety of different forms, depending on their situation. Some seem like normal and perhaps even charming survivors, except to their targets. These “nice” cannibals may eat human flesh when desperate or to take advantage of meat that would otherwise go to waste. Or maybe they’ve developed a taste for human flesh.

Others look the part, having descended into the kind of bestial, erratic behavior that cannibalism can inflict on long term practitioners.

Some are part of a crazed settlement of raiders always looking for more sweet meats, and others hide in plain sight, pretending friendship and offering aid to strangers until their prey lowers their guard. Some cannibals like their prey raw; others delight in elaborate preparations.

Whether becoming an eater of human flesh was forced by circumstance or out of some secret, maladaptive urge, cannibals are dangerous.

**Motive:** Hunger for human flesh
**Environment:** In areas where food is scarce; alone, or in groups of four to ten
**Health:** 12
**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
**Movement:** Short
**Modifications:** Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and friendly interaction as level 6

**Combat:** Cannibals use improvised weapons, like ropes, chair legs, and jagged pieces of broken glass. A few cannibals with more resources rely on long range firearms and rifles until they run out of ammunition.

In any group of four or more cannibals, there’s probably one (revealed as a GM intrusion) who has filed their teeth and can make a horrific bite attack once every minute or two. This attack inflicts damage and requires the target to succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failure, the cannibal bites off a bit of the target, who is stunned and loses their next turn. See the Cannibal Severing Bite Effects table.

**Interaction:** A friendly and charming cannibal may remain so indefinitely, unless they decide a PC is perfect for dinner.

**Use:** Characters looking for a place to sleep, hide, or stay for the night are invited in by one or more cannibals. A group of raiders the PCs must negotiate with are also revealed to be cannibals.

**Loot:** A cannibal has currency equivalent to an expensive item.

| 5 | Ear; target’s perception task that rely on hearing are hindered until target adapts |
| 6 | Throat; target descends on step on damage track each round until ally succeeds on a difficulty 5 healing task |

### FOUR HOURSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE

#### BEAST: Level 6 (18)

Beast (also called “Conquest”) is present at mass shootings and acts of genocide. He is adroit at spreading misinformation and, prior to the apocalypse, was often seen on various “newstainment” shows and conspiracy theory websites, spreading lies under an alias. Then and now, he appears in a white suit, accessorized with white shades and gloves. His hair is white, too.

**Motive:** Spread lies; incite others to rabid acts of cruelty
**Environment:** Almost anywhere with a dupe he’s gaslighted and/or with one or more of the Four
**Health:** 24
**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
**Armor:** 1
**Movement:** Short; long when mounted or riding
**Modifications:** Deception as level 8

**Combat:** Beast prefers that others fight in his stead. Those convinced of his lies ease their attacks and defenses, and deal 2 additional points of damage with a successful attack. If forced into conflict, Beast produces a handgun, making two long range attacks as his action. The first time any target is hit by Beast in combat, that target takes damage and must succeed on an Intellect defense roll. A failed roll means the target mistakenly believes one of their allies attacked them instead of Beast. The target gets a new Intellect defense roll each round to realize their error.

As one of the Four, Beast can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced a mass shooting or genocidal act.

**Interaction:** Beast comes across as a kind truth teller, someone “just asking questions,” but it doesn’t take long for perceptive people to realize he’s a consummate, continual gaslighter, always working to manipulate others.

**Use:** A sniper on the ridge tries to pick the PCs off as they pass across a bridge. Behind the sniper stands a man in white.

#### SWORD: Level 6 (18)

Sword (also called “War”) is never far from large‑scale conflicts. She glories in battle and warfare, and before the world ended, she was a provocateur, a mercenary, a soldier, and sometimes a general. However, once a war is good and started, she prefers fighting over watching. Then and now, she dresses in red, preferring red military attire and a massive sword—or assault rifle—the color of blood.

**Motive:** Hunger for combat; incite war
**Environment:** Almost anywhere war is waged and/or with one or more of the Four
**Health:** 24
**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
**Armor:** 3
**Movement:** Short; usually has a red mount or vehicle nearby
**Modifications:** Attacks as level 8

**Combat:** Sword’s blood colored weapon is either a greatsword or an assault rifle, whatever she needs it to be in the moment. She attacks three times with the sword as her action. With the rifle, she can make one very long range attack (with no hindrance despite the range) or two long range attacks.

As part of her attack, she can imbue one bullet each round with an explosive charge. If the attack hits, in addition to normal damage, the target and everyone within immediate range of the target must succeed on a Speed defense roll or take 6 points of damage from shrapnel, or 2 points even with a successful roll.

As one of the Four, Sword can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced war.

**Interaction:** Sword is full of swagger, often causing fights with biting insults. However, if she can’t incite a fight, she’s just as happy to start one herself, especially as part of a false flag operation.

**Use:** A band of raiders, dozens strong, appears on the horizon. Leading them is a woman on a red horse.

#### FAMINE: Level 6 (18)

Famine delighted in economic collapse and starvation before the apocalypse. They still spend time destabilizing survivor groups’ livelihoods by direct and indirect means. Famine is rail thin, and carries a chain weapon with weighted, disc shaped ends that can also be used as an improvised scale.

**Motive:** Starve the living; destabilize organized groups
**Environment:** Almost anywhere people are starving and/or with one or more of the Four
**Health:** 24
**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
**Armor:** 1
**Movement:** Short; usually has a black mount or vehicle nearby
**Modifications:** Intellect defense as level 8

**Combat:** Famine attacks foes with their chain weapon, attacking up to two targets within immediate range at once, or a single target within short range. On a hit, they inflict damage and can choose to entangle one target, who is held helpless on a failed Might defense roll until they escape. Entangled targets automatically take damage each round from the tightening chains. Alternatively, Famine can release a pulse of decay once every few hours that affects all creatures and food stores within short range. Food automatically goes bad, losing all nutritional value. Living targets in the area that fail a Might defense roll feel an overwhelming pang of hunger and descend one step on the damage track. As one of the Four, Famine can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death through starvation or other privation.

**Interaction:** Famine is keen to talk about delicacies of every kind, becoming more animated and descriptive about mouthwatering foods and drinks the hungrier those nearby are.

**Use:** The characters are trying to help a group of survivors transport much‑needed food stores to their community when someone all in black on a black motorcycle appears on the road ahead.

#### PLAGUE: Level 6 (18)

Plague (often called “Death”) is present wherever people die of disease or infirmity brought on by age. She prefers black and pale green evening wear, including long pale green gloves and often a grinning skull mask. When traveling, she drives a pale green hearse or motorcycle, or rides a horse the same sickly green color.

**Motive:** Death
**Environment:** Almost anywhere people are dying (but especially of disease and/or old age) and/or with one or more of the Four
**Health:** 24
**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
**Armor:** 1
**Movement:** Short; usually has a pale green mount or vehicle nearby
**Modifications:** Might defense as level 8

**Combat:** When she wishes, Plague wields a scythe, as if she had always been holding it. She attacks twice with it as her action. On a hit, the scythe deals damage and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the target contracts a supernatural disease requiring that they succeed on a Might defense roll each minute or descend one step on the damage track. If an affected target succeeds on three Might defense rolls at any point, they recover. If Plague removes a glove as an action, she can use her next action to imbue her scythe with necrotic power, or simply touch a target with her bare hand. On a hit with either her touch or the imbued scythe, she inflicts damage, and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll or die. Plague can use this ability about once a day, or immediately again if her previous target dies because of it. As one of the Four, Plague can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death by disease or due to old age.

**Interaction:** Of all the Four, Plague is the most changeable in outlook, and sometimes is even somewhat sympathetic to humanity’s plight. When she’s in such a mood, persuasive characters could convince Plague to pass them over, though she promises that it’s only a temporary stay of death.

**Use:** The characters find a before‑times bunker filled with corpses killed by some strange infection, plus a living “human” wearing a black and pale green evening gown.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gamma Worm <---> 6 (18) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Gamma worms hide their large forms by burrowing beneath the ground, and when they emerge on the surface, they cloak themselves behind psychic distortion fields. The only clue someone has that they’re being stalked is a smell of cloves over the stale whiff of death. Unfortunately, if someone smells a gamma worm’s distinctive odor, it’s probably already too late.

Gamma worms might be the result of military research, radioactive mutation, or aliens or other strange intruders seeking to eradicate human life as part of their terraforming efforts to change Earth to their liking.

**Motive:** Hunger for flesh; eliminate humans
**Environment:** Almost anywhere
**Health:** 18
**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
**Armor:** 2 (immune to radiation)
**Movement:** Short; short when burrowing
**Modifications:** Stealth as level 8 when psychic field active; Speed defense as level 5 due to size; ability to see through tricks as level 4

**Combat:** Gamma worms attacks twice each round with blades they unfold from their wormlike lengths. Alternatively, about once each hour a gamma worm can unleash a hail of gamma spikes against up to three targets within short range. Targets struck by the spikes take damage and must succeed on a Might defense roll or fall unconscious. Unconscious targets wake up a few rounds later feeling dizzy and slightly sick to their stomach—they’ve developed radiation sickness.

Gamma worms can use their action to generate a psychic field that effectively grants them invisibility. The invisibility lasts until they attack or move more than an immediate distance on their turn.

Gamma worms are vulnerable to cold; in chilly conditions, their Speed defense is hindered by four steps. In addition, cold attacks ignore their Armor.

**Interaction:** Gamma worms act like prey driven monsters, but they may have a secret language and purpose (if aliens placed them on Earth to hasten the apocalypse or kill survivors in the post apocalyptic world).

**Use:** Irradiated and hungry gamma worms emerge from the ruins to hunt fresh meat in outlying communities.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Glowing Roach <---> 2 (6) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Radiation born mutant roaches are terrible individually, but absolutely horrible in swarms. Many times the size of roaches in the before times, these firefly like creatures prefer dark areas, such as ruined subways and abandoned basements.

Some swarms are rumored to have an insidious group intelligence, one that is utterly inimical to humankind.

**Motive:** Hunger for flesh
**Environment:** Anywhere dark, usually in nests of four to ten (or more)
**Health:** 6
**Damage Inflicted:** 2 points
**Armor:** 2
**Movement:** Short; short when flying
**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 3 due to small size; perception as level 5

**Combat:** A glowing roach attacks with radioactive mandibles. When four glowing roaches act together, they can make a single attack as a level 4 creature inflicting 4 points of damage. Targets damaged by a group of glowing roaches must also succeed on a difficulty 4 Might defense task or face additional consequences from the effects of radiation and slashing mandibles, as determined on the Glowing Roach Effects table. The effects are cumulative and last until a target makes a recovery roll.

Sometimes a single glowing roach mutates further, allowing it to grow into a 20 foot (6 m) long monstrosity. Thankfully, these monstrous glowing roaches are rare and seldom come out into the light.

Roaches dislike bright illumination: in sunlight or other bright light, glowing roach attacks are hindered.

**Monstrous glowing roach:** level 5, Speed defense as level 4; Armor 2; mandible attack inflicts 7 damage and results in a check on the Glowing Roach Effects table.

**Interaction:** Glowing roaches almost always react like voracious insects, despite their size. That is, except for swarms of ten or more, which act like sapient creatures. Sapient swarms may try to lure survivors, possibly even spelling out human readable letters in the sand that anonymously ask for help or promise it. But it’s a ruse; they despise humans for all the ways people used to exterminate roaches in the before times.

**Use:** A visit to a ruined hospital or airport scares up a few glowing roaches when light is introduced to a dark place.

**Glowing Roach Effects**

| D6 | Effect |
|----|---|
| 1 | Head wound: Intellect defense tasks hindered |
| 2 | Wounded leg: Speed defense tasks hindered |
| 3 | Gut wound: Might defense tasks hindered |
| 4 | Spit in eye: Perception tasks hindered |
| 5 | Limb numb: Physical tasks hindered |
| 6 | Lingering radioactive effect: Refer to Radiation in the Real World and possibly Incredible Mutations if your game has such fantastic elements. |

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hooked Blossom <---> 2 (6) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Hooked blossoms germinate almost like regular plants but can root even on constructed surfaces, including cement and sometimes metal. Rooted juveniles display pinkish flowers—which some equate to the color of an open wound—that give off an alluring perfume.

If they mature, they uproot themselves, revealing an ambulatory body plated in a dull grey metallic hide and limbs that end in a single hook like digit.

Both forms are dangerous. The most common variety of rooted blossoms work in small groups to cook prey with focused beams of microwave energy. Ambulatory versions are about the size of large domestic cats. They use their sharp limbs to hook themselves into a target, then use their flowers to cook their prey or, alternatively, put them to sleep for later consumption.

**Juvenile, rooted blossom:** level 1; Armor 1; a group of five flowers attacks with a level 3 microwave ray inflicting 3 ambient damage

**Motive:** Hunger for flesh
**Environment:** In groups of five or more anyplace touched by radiation, mutation, or AI genetic‑nanotech engineering
**Health:** 6
**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
**Armor:** 2
**Movement:** Short; immediate when climbing
**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to size; disguise as level 6 when not moving

**Combat:** A mature blossom attacks twice with its hooks, inflicting damage with each strike. If a blossom hits a target, the target must succeed on a second Speed defense roll, which is hindered. On a failed roll, the blossom hooks itself to the target until the target can detach the blossom with a successful Might roll as their action. Each round a blossom is hooked to a target, the target automatically takes 3 points of ambient damage from microwave energy emitted by the creature’s bloom. Some varieties of hooked blossoms produce soporific pollen (treat as poison) instead of microwaves. If a character is hooked by one of these blossoms, they must instead succeed on an Intellect defense roll each round they remain hooked, or fall asleep. A sleeping target must be roused by an ally or suffer physical damage to wake. Each round a target remains asleep, they automatically take 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). In its juvenile, rooted form, a hooked blossom resembles a flower with a metallic stem, which is dangerous when active. In direct sunlight, a rooted hooked blossom regains 1 point of health each round.

**Interaction:** Hooked blossoms act much like animal predators, though they are not concerned with self‑preservation.

**Use:** The scavenging PCs spy a flower‑clad hill in the distance, shining in the sun. Even from here, they can smell the pleasant perfume drifting on the breeze.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Melted <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Survivors assume the melted are another strain of mutants. Maybe so, but they’re not originally from Earth. Or rather, not this Earth. The melted leaked in from a parallel world’s apocalypse caused by a snafu with a high energy supercollider. Dozens of different but parallel timelines smashed into each other. The few survivors were fused beings composed of many different alternate versions of the same person, each still “radioactive” with latent transdimensional energy.

**Motive:** Surcease from constant pain; absorb more sapient beings
**Environment:** Groups of three to five roaming the ruins
**Health:** 15
**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points; see Combat
**Movement:** Short
**Modifications:** Initiative and Speed defense as level 5 due to seeing a second into the future

**Combat:** The melted attack with two claws.

If a melted defeats a foe, they “consume” it by drawing it fully into their body cavity as their action, healing the melted for 10 health and giving the creature a few hours free of pain, allowing their mind to clear.

A given melted may also have a trait associated with the transdimensional energy they burn with.

**Interaction:** A few of the melted gain moments of clarity, but all are burdened with anguish stemming from their fused state. They unleash their full fury on whoever and whatever they catch among the ruins, but they seem particularly bent on finding and absorbing scientists.

**Use:** A group of the melted seek out a surviving scientific installation and attempt to consume everyone nearby.

**Loot:** One out of three melted may carry a manifest cypher (in the form of before times military tech), such as an armor reinforcer or a sonic detonation.

**Transdimensional Energy Enhancement**

| D6 | Effect |
|----|---|
| 1 | Enhanced strength: Attacks inflict 6 points of damage (instead of 4) |
| 2 | Healing factor: Regains 2 health each round |
| 3 | Bite: In addition to their claw attacks, makes a bit attack each round that inflicts 6 points of damage |
| 4 | Gravitic repulsion: Flies a long distance each round |
| 5 | Dimensional instability: Teleports up to a long distance before or after each attack |
| 6 | Transdimensional blast: About once each hour, emits transdimensional energy filling an adjacent short area; all creatures in the area take 6 points of ambient damage on a failed Might defense roll, as parts of them temporarily fuse with other affect creatures, or creatures in alternate dimensions |

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Radioactive Bear <---> 7 (21) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Exposure to radiation and other mutagens—or possibly the malign design of some before times military lab or inscrutable AI instance—transformed an already large and aggressive bear into something truly horrific. Standing well over 20 feet (6 m) tall, radioactive bears are drawn to radioactive areas, which empower and sustain them, though not completely. Which is why sometimes they head into uncontaminated areas to hunt large game. They especially prefer people.

**Motive:** Hunger for flesh and radiation
**Environment:** Anywhere radioactive
**Health:** 35
**Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
**Armor:** 1 (immune to radiation)
**Movement:** Short
**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to size; perception as level 8

**Combat:** Creatures within immediate range of a radioactive bear are irradiated on a failed Might defense task, hindering their tasks on their next turn.

The bear attacks twice each round with its claws, or bites once. If its bite attack succeeds against a target suffering from radiation sickness, the bear regains 5 points of health.

On a target’s failed Might defense roll, the bear holds the target in its jaws, hindering their tasks until they can escape. If the bear begins its turn with a target held in its jaws, the bear automatically deals bite damage as its action.

As an action, the bear can cough forth a radioactive cloud once every few hours (and again if the bear is killed), targeting everything within immediate range. Targets that fail a Might defense roll take damage from the radiation.

If the radioactive bear is the result of military or AI design rather than a natural mutation, it may also have a mechanism capable of firing a long range laser at distant targets, deployed from a harness fused to the creature’s flesh.

In areas of dangerous radiation, the radioactive bear regains 2 points of health each round.

**Interaction:** Radioactive bears are clever predators, sly if they need to be. If not too hungry, a radioactive bear might let potential prey pass it by, assuming they don’t antagonize the bear.

**Use:** The characters glance behind them as they drive their vehicle across the landscape and see a huge bear, apparently giving chase.

### RAIDER

Stripped of humanity by brutal living conditions and their determination to survive no matter the cost, raiders still look human. But beneath that veneer, they’re feral.

**Motive:** Raid and kill for what they want
**Environment:** Groups of four to six roaming the ruins
**Interaction:** If a raider believes a just met survivor has food, water, or shelter, or might prove to be a threat immediately or at any later date, they laugh off any suggestion of parley and attack.
**Use:** The raider encampment has a new leader, a warlord whose presence doubles raider activity.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Fell Rider <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Motorcycle riding raiders keep their “motor wheels” alive through constant tinkering and repair. The two wheeled machines are modified with spears, spikes, lances, and sometimes guns and flamethrowers. Fell riders wear heavy protective garments made from fur, salvaged clothing, and leather from past targets. Goggles protect their eyes, and bones are sewn through their wild, greasy hair as decoration.

**Health:** 12
**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
**Armor:** 1
**Movement:** Short; long while riding motorcycle
**Modifications:** Motorcycle repair and modification as level 5; stealth tasks as level 0 due to screaming engines

**Combat:** Using pikes, spears, or lances welded to the front of their bike, a fell rider typically makes ride‑by attacks against foes from just outside short range. A fell rider is one with their bike, always moving to engage and disengage. If knocked from their bike (possibly a minor effect), a fell rider’s attacks and Speed defenses are hindered until they regain the seat as their action. Some riders use larger four‑wheeled vehicles with open canopies instead of motorcycles. These fell riders have 2 Armor and can attempt a run‑down attack on up to three targets that are next to each other and not in a vehicle, inflicting 8 points of damage. Struck targets that fail a Might defense roll descend one step on the damage track.

**Loot:** A fell rider’s motorcycle, when repaired, is a useful vehicle with enough gas for miles of travel.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Marauder <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Marauders are raiders who attack with stealth, wrapping themselves in light smothering clothes and targeting survivors after midnight. By day, they act like regular people, part of a survivor community. That’s pretense; when time allows, they torture targets to death and take flesh trophies.

**Health:** 12
**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points; see Combat
**Movement:** Short; short when climbing
**Modifications:** Stealth and deception tasks as level 5

**Combat:** Marauders use stealth and the night to position themselves before attacking, hoping to make their initial attack with surprise using bladed weapons. Whether they have surprise or not, if they attack before their target’s first action, their attacks are eased and inflict 6 points of damage.

Marauders often dose their bladed weapons with poison, so targets must also make a Might defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round for three rounds.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Warlord <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
A warlord enjoys supreme authority over other raiders. Brutal rulers, warlords are a living symbol of power and strength where survival is valued above all else.

Warlords caparison themselves in trophies of vanquished enemies—such as gilded skulls or flayed skins. Some wear garish helms designed to intimidate. An impressive weapon, especially something from the before times, is always close at hand. A warlord is rarely encountered without raiders and other lackeys that fight for and serve them.

**Motive:** Control through fear and brutality
**Environment:** Usually in the company of five to twenty raiders
**Health:** 25
**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
**Armor:** 3
**Movement:** Short
**Modifications:** Defends as level 6 due to nearby raiders willing to take no actions other than defend the warlord

**Combat:** Warlords attack twice each round with bladed or spiked melee weapons or ranged firearms. When possible, they fight from an open canopy vehicle (driven by another raider).

A warlord directly leads the raiders they command, fighting at the forefront but also issuing orders. Underlings deal 1 additional point of damage when the warlord can see them and issue commands.

Most warlords have a specific additional advantage they can pull out to win a fight. See the table below.

**Interaction:** Warlords have lackeys and lieutenants that interact with outsiders. They prefer to make pronouncements and threats from on high.

**Use:** The museum, lab, or other important structure the characters wanted to visit to carry out their mission has fallen under the control of a warlord and a dozen or more raiders.

**Loot:** A warlord may carry an artifact.

**Unique Warlord Advantage**

| D6 | Advantage |
|----|---|
| 1 | Rocket launcher (level 7): long‑range weapon inflicts 7 points of damage on targets in an immediate area (depletion: 1–2 in 1d6) |
| 2 | Fire thrower (level 7): immediate‑range weapon inflicts 7 points of damage on all targets within immediate range (depletion: 1 in 1d10) |
| 3 | Release the beast: Gives the command to “release the beast”; a melted loyal to warlord charges into the fight |
| 4 | Force shield (level 5): Static field blocks all incoming attacks against the warlord for one round (depletion: 1–2 in 1d10) |
| 5 | Power gauntlet: Warlord’s power gauntlet grabs foe and automatically deals damage from crushing until foe escapes |
| 6 | Skystrike: Calls in a “skystrike” from a battered wristband; a round later, a missile launched from a before‑times satellite strikes nearby, inflicting 10 points of damage on all creatures within a short area who fail a Speed defense roll, and 2 points on those who succeed (depletion: automatic) |

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Ai Zombie <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
An artificial intelligence that permanently installs itself onto the wetware (in this case, the brain) of a human or other sapient creature creates an AI zombie. The AI replaces the person’s personality and motivations, turning them into a shambling creature who only does the AI’s bidding, even as their body decays and falls apart (though most keep shambling because of an injection of nano repair bots).

AI zombies are driven by a single, simple motive implanted by the original artificial intelligence—usually related to destroying resources before competing AI instances can use them. They aren’t intelligent enough to direct themselves or problem solve outside of this goal, unless the AI takes direct control, using a particular AI zombie as a remote “terminal” from which to act and observe the world.

**Motive:** Follow dictates of AI that created or that controls them
**Environment:** Almost anywhere, in groups of five to seven, or in hordes of tens to hundreds
**Health:** 12
**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
**Movement:** Immediate
**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 2; perception tasks as level 7

**Combat:** AI zombies fight on, no matter the odds, usually attacking by biting.

When AI zombies attack in groups of five to seven individuals, they can make a single attack roll against one target as one level 5 creature, inflicting 5 points of damage.

AI zombies are hard to finish off because self repairing nanotech stitched into their flesh restores 1 point of health each round. If reduced to 0 health, there is a 50% chance that the nanotech continues to function on the zombie’s turn, allowing the creature to shudder back to life, skin crawling with miniscule “healing” robots. (If an AI zombie is cut off from ambient radio signals, they do not regain health each round.)

That same nanotech makes AI zombies infectious. Their bites spread a level 6 (or, in some cases, level 8) disease due to miniscule machines that move a target down one step on the damage track each day a Might defense roll is failed. Targets killed by the process later animate as AI zombies, compelled to serve an AI instance.

**Interaction:** AI zombies often serve some distant AI and may sometimes speak with its voice. But if cut off from its intelligence source, the zombie itself becomes a food seeking monster, more likely to eat someone than to represent an artificial mind.

**Use:** The characters are asked to salvage supplies from an abandoned airplane hangar—abandoned, that is, except for lingering AI zombies.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Zombie Hulk <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Most zombies are mindless, shambling, hungry, and infectious. Some varieties, despite their semblance to corpses, enjoy a regenerative process that keeps them active regardless of grievous wounds, rotting flesh, and sometimes missing limbs or organs. That same process kicks into overdrive in zombie hulks, converting everything they eat into additional mass and muscle. The result is three times as massive as a regular zombie and five times as dangerous.

**ZOMBIE SPRINTER:** Instead of being much larger than normal, a zombie’s regenerative system can imbue it with incredible quickness, making it much faster than the shamblers often encountered. The resulting zombie sprinter’s speed and ferocity make it hard to escape.

**Zombie sprinter:** level 3, initiative as level 5; moves a long distance each round; three bites per round inflict 3 damage each; retains 1 health if attack roll result that would have downed it was an even number

**Motive:** Hunger (for flesh, cerebrospinal fluid, certain human hormones, or whatever it is that nourishes the zombie in the setting)
**Environment:** Almost anywhere, alone or with other zombie varieties
**Health:** 23
**Damage Inflicted:** 8 points
**Armor:** 2
**Movement:** Short
**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 3 due to size; perception as level 7

**Combat:** A zombie hulk bashes with massive, permanently balled fists stained with the gore of past targets.

Alternatively, a zombie hulk can bite a target. When this occurs, it’s almost impossible to force the hulk’s jaws apart again. When a target takes damage from a bite, they must also succeed on a Speed defense roll or one of their limbs is clamped in the hulk’s mouth. The target automatically takes damage each round they are caught, and all their tasks are hindered, including attempts to escape. Meanwhile, the hulk is free to bash other foes as its action even as it chews on a previously caught target.

If an attack would reduce the zombie hulk’s health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled for the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zombie is reduced to 1 point of health instead.

**Interaction:** A zombie hulk may choose to smash a nearby structure instead of going straight toward food, but it is typically a mindless, unreasoning monster.

**Use:** Just when it seems like the characters understand the situation with zombies, a zombie hulk appears, making it clear that bizarre and dangerous zombie permutations are possible. If a regular zombie can become a hulk, what other ways can they mutate and evolve?

## Post-Apocalyptic Threats, Hazards, and GM Intrusions

**Using the Tables:** Choose or roll randomly when you need a hazard to threaten the PCs. As described under scavenging, attempts to find food, water, useful stuff, or just a safe place to hole up could also require a roll on the table.

### Realistic Threats and Hazards

| D100 | Threat or Hazard |
|------|------------------|
| 01-03 | **Blocked road:** The road ahead is so filled with abandoned, rusted before‑times vehicles that the PCs must walk if they want to take that route. Walkers are unable to see more than an immediate distance in any direction between the cars. If PCs have a vehicle larger than a bicycle, they’ll have to find another way or leave it behind. |
| 04-06 | **Setting‑specific element:** Choose a hazard from a set piece or optional rule you’re using, or if you want to shake things up, roll on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table. Or just choose the next result on this table. |
| 07-10 | **Angry ants (level 2):** Thousands of biting ants pour from cracks in the pavement, attacking everything in an immediate area, inflicting 2 points of damage if they hit a target and, on a failed Might defense roll, dazing targets with pain for one round. Even if a target succeeds on its initial Speed defense roll, it takes 1 point of damage because the ants are everywhere. |
| 11-14 | **Enraged wasps (level 3):** This wasp swarm acts as a single level 3 creature whose stinging attacks ignore Armor. Attacks on the swarm that don’t deal area damage inflict only 1 point of damage. |
| 15-17 | **Cannibal convoy:** A before‑times RV pulls up. It’s the current property of a group of four to ten people who make the biofuel the vehicle runs on. They seem nice, but they’re actually cannibals thinking of inviting the PCs for dinner. |
| 18-20 | **Earthquake, minor (level 3):** The ground within long range of an epicenter heaves and shakes for one or more minutes. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage due to the general shaking on a failed Speed defense roll, or 6 points of damage if they are in or adjacent to a structure or terrain feature shedding debris on a failed Speed defense roll. |
| 21-23 | **Radioactive crater (level 3):** Inflicts 3 points of ambient damage per round and moves the character one step down the damage track each day they fail a difficulty 5 Might defense task. |
| 24-26 | **Radioactive storm (level 3):** Treat as a radioactive crater, but one that moves. |
| 27-29 | **Exposed electrical wiring, minor (level 3):** Inflicts 3 points of damage per round of contact, and the character is stunned and unable to take their next action until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Might defense task. |
| 30-33 | **Dilapidated infrastructure, minor (level 3):** The floor gives way beneath a character who falls 30 feet (9 m) on a failed Speed defense roll, taking 3 points of ambient damage and moving one step down the damage track. |
| 34-40 | **Poisoned waters, minor (level 3):** Whether it’s water flooding a structure, a stream, a swamp, or a lake, drinking it inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 1 point of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task. |
| 41-48 | **Bridge, dangerous (level 4+):** PCs on an overpass, train trestle, or other bridge must make a Speed defense roll as a section gives way beneath their feet, potentially dropping them 40 to 200 feet (12 to 60 m). |
| 49-53 | **Burning structure (level 4):** Everything in or within immediate range of this fire takes 4 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. If PCs can’t get away, choking smoke in the area means they must succeed on Might defense rolls each round or suffer 2 points of ambient damage and lose their next action. |
| 54-57 | **Choking pollution (level 4):** Asbestos and other substances once safely bound up in the infrastructure are loose, sometimes as clouds of dangerous particulate matter inflicting 4 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll. |
| 58-67 | **Raider patrol:** Whether on scavenged trucks or motorcycles, or riding mutant pigs bred as war mounts (war pigs), a group of three to six fell riders is bad news. |
| 68-72 | **Avalanche (level 5):** A rumble precedes the falling snow as an avalanche of snow threatens to bury the PCs. (The avalanche could be debris or rubble instead of snow.) |
| 73-75 | **Dilapidated infrastructure, major (level 5):** The building, underpass tunnel, or cave collapses, or the bridge over which the vehicle is passing crumbles. Characters suffer 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 5 Speed task are buried under suffocating rubble until they can escape or are rescued. For additional danger, treat as an unstable structure. |
| 76-78 | **Disease (level 5+):** Even if the world didn’t end because of a pandemic, disease threatens the PCs when they meet a group of especially unlucky (and diseased) survivors. |
| 79-80 | **Flooded region (level 5):** A failed Speed defense roll means the rushing waters envelop the character, inflicting 5 points of damage and moving them a short distance in the direction of the water’s flow. A serious flood could further endanger the character. |
| 81    | **Firenado (level 5):** Fire generates a vortex of flame and smoke, creating a rotating column of air that draws in flames and debris, resulting in a powerful whirlwind of fire. The vortex moves an immediate distance (on a roll of 1–3 on a d6) or a short distance (on a roll of 4–6 on a d6) each round in a random direction, persisting for 1d6 + 2 rounds before dispersing. Anyone intersected by the firenado’s immediate‑radius area takes 5 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. The PC must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled up into the firenado, burned for another 5 points of damage, and hurled in a random direction a short distance, which inflicts another 5 points of damage from falling and/or impacting other structures. |
| 82-84 | **Poisoned waters, major (level 5):** Drinking this slightly glowing water inflicts 5 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task. |
| 85-86 | **Just a bear, but a big one:** A regular grizzly bear is always frightening, before or after the end. |
| 87-88 | **Nuclear fallout (level 5):** Radioactive dust drifts to the ground or precipitates out as rain. PCs in the area suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute, and if they remain for an hour or longer, they’re subject to radiation sickness. |
| 89-91 | **Toxic spill (level 5):** Sticky orange goo bursts from rusted ancient barrels. Characters who fail a Speed defense task are caught and held in place until they can escape the morass, taking 5 points of damage each round they remain stuck. |
| 92-94 | **Unexploded ordnance (level 5):** A buried land mine inflicts 5 points of damage to everything within short range if trod upon or otherwise set off. |
| 95-97 | **Superstorm (level 6):** With the climate destabilized, storms of unprecedented strength sometimes blow, creating winds that inflict 6 points of damage each round targets are exposed. |
| 98-99 | **Radiation, extreme (level 8):** This area was recently hit by a nuclear bomb or other extreme radioactive event, and those in the area for more than a minute who fail a Might defense roll suffer from radiation sickness. |
| 00 | **Unexploded nuclear warhead (level 10):** If not defused, it could kill everything in a several‑mile radius and is likely radioactive to boot. |

**Grizzly bear:** level 5; health 20; Armor 1
**War pig:** level 3; rider has asset on melee attacks, or pig can make a separate tusk attack when rider attacks

### Fantastic Threats and Hazards

| D20 | Threat or Hazard |
|-----|------------------|
| 1 | **Hallucinatory flowers (level 3):** The ground floor of the ruin hosts a handful of purplish flowers growing up out of the rubble. A character who gets a puff of the pollen hallucinates their allies are actually cannibals trying to eat the affected character each round until the character succeeds on a Might defense roll. |
| 2 | **AI instance, minor (level 3):** An artificial intelligence in an old facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals. |
| 3-4 | **Voracious cockroach swarm (level 3):** This swarm, easily covering an area a short distance in diameter, doesn’t shrink from the light or from people. Indeed, it seems eerily intelligent, and if threatened, it attacks, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on everything in its area that fails a Speed defense roll, or 1 point on a successful roll. |
| 5 | **Animate vegetation (level 4):** Kudzu got a lot worse in the aftermath. Characters that fail a Speed defense roll take 4 points of damage each round from strangulation and vine constriction until they can escape |
| 6 | **Ashy tide (level 4):** A series of powerful wind gusts in the area kicks up a lot of fine grey ash. Except it’s not ash—it’s a collection of nanobots, each the size of a grain of sand or smaller, called ashy tide. |
| 7-8 | **Glowing roach infestation:** Four to ten glowing roaches the size of dogs have truly come into their own now that they’ve grown in stature and intelligence. They have little use for survivors, except as food. |
| 9 | **Psychic lichen (level 4):** Psychic lichen gently attacks the minds of nearby creatures, causing them to grow tired and nap if they fail an Intellect defense roll. If not awakened, the dozing body serves as food for a new psychic lichen colony. |
| 10 | **Strike from the heavens (level 4):** A before‑times war satellite becomes active and fires a focused microwave beam at the PCs in the area, inflicting 4 points of damage each round they remain in the area without solid cover and fail a Might defense roll, or 2 points on a successful roll. |
| 11 | **Abomination lair:** The abomination was a person once, or its ancestors were. Not anymore. |
| 12 | **Fiery fissure (level 5):** A crack splinters the ground along a newly forming fire‑filled fissure that stretches a long distance, zigging and zagging to catch several more targets than it might otherwise. PCs who fail a Speed defense roll fall in and are burned for 5 points of damage each round until they can climb out or be pulled out with a successful Might task as an action. |
| 13 | **Glowing tide (level 5):** Veins of yellow‑gold light branching across surfaces (roads, buildings, and bare earth) indicate that nanites are probably active, creating a dangerous area of glowing tide. |
| 14 | **Time anomaly (level 5):** The PCs encounter a wall of golden light whose interior ripples with lightning. It’s a time storm, and either it blocks the PCs’ path, or worse, it’s gradually sweeping toward the characters. |
| 15 | **AI instance, major (level 6):** An artificial intelligence in a powered facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI (because an instance of the AI is running in their head). A target can make a new Intellect defense roll each day to try to reject the control. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals. |
| 16 | **Hungry tide (level 6):** A greyish‑green mist of nanobots a short distance in diameter drifts in the wind, until the hungry tide senses living organisms and moves a short distance each round toward them. |
| 17 | **Quantum singularity (level 6):** Attempts to change the past to avert the apocalypse have consequences, including these points of unstable space‑time. Characters who fail an Intellect defense task are teleported a short distance in a random direction and possibly several hours forward in time. |
| 18-19 | **Rampaging wardroid (level 6):** Wardroids may be what caused the apocalypse in the first place; whatever the case, one has wandered directly into the PCs’ path. |
| 20 | **Mutant bear:** The house‑sized radioactive bear, whose roar can be heard for miles, is something to avoid. |

### GM Intrusions for Post-Apocalyptic Games

If you’re running a game set in the ruins following civilization’s fall, refer to the following list of unexpected complications to your PCs’ day. GM intrusions can happen anytime, whether the PCs think they’re safe in a defended settlement or recently secured shelter, or traveling across the wasteland.

Select a GM intrusion appropriate to the situation, roll one randomly, or use the list to inspire an intrusion of your own.

*   01–02 (group): Roll on the preceding Realistic Threats and Hazards table, or on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table if your game includes fantastic elements.
*   03–04: The character is surprised by a diseased feral cat, which bites them and runs off, infecting the PC with a level 4 disease that drops them one step on the damage track each day they fail a Might defense roll.
*   05–06 (group or character): The PCs’ mode of transport breaks (or someone’s boot heel snaps off), requiring about an hour of repair, possibly meaning that they have to duck into nearby ruins to find parts.
*   07–08: A weirdly gnarled hand emerges from the ground or ruin, grabs the character, and pulls them down into an ancient bunker containing a zombie hulk.
*   09–10 (group): The PCs discover their food and water supplies have become contaminated with poisonous mold or dangerous levels of radiation (level 4).
*   11–12 (group): An unseasonal blizzard forces the PCs to seek shelter in an abandoned train yard, which shows signs of being claimed by another group of survivors.
*   13–14: The character treads on a sticky slurry of ooze leaking from a ruined factory that holds them in place unless they give up their footwear and/or succeed on a difficulty 5 Might task to pull free.
*   15–16: A radioactive spider bites the character, inflicting 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), and on a failed difficulty 3 Might defense roll, the character develops one harmful mutation. Each day the PC can attempt another Might defense roll; with a success, the mutation subsides.
*   17–18 (group): A wildfire or structural fire (level 5) moves through the area; PCs must run before it to survive. However, when the fire has burnt out several hours later, the PCs are lost.
*   19–20 (group): A sinkhole opens beneath the PCs’ vehicle, which becomes hopelessly stuck in loose earth until they can succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to push it out. If PCs don’t have a vehicle, the sinkhole sucks down one character and threatens to smother them unless the others succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to extract them.
*   21–22: The PC discovers they are infested with mutant green lice (level 5); Might tasks (including defense rolls) are hindered until the PC is treated with appropriate cleansing chemicals.
*   23–24 (group): High winds, acidic precipitation, or a drift of grey goo eats through the PCs’ shelter’s roof.
*   25–26: The character wakes to discover that some of their equipment has been pilfered, but the PC on watch didn’t see anything (and isn’t responsible for the theft). Investigation reveals that weirdly smart termites (level 4) working together made off with the item.
*   27–28 (group): Yellow mushrooms with black speckles (level 4) grow profusely in the area and ooze weirdly blood‑like fluid when brushed or trod upon, or simply as PCs pass by. The mushrooms are poisonous, inflicting 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if ingested, but they also grant PCs a one‑time asset on any knowledge tasks they attempt during the next ten hours.
*   29–30 (group): That buzzing noise that’s been getting louder and louder is revealed as a swarm of aggressive, stinging radioactive bees.
    *   **Radioactive bees, swarm:** level 5; stings inflict 6 damage and, on failed Might defense roll, an allergic reaction dealing 1 Speed damage (ignores Armor) each minute until target is tended.
*   31–32 (group): The PCs enter a region threatened by pockets of explosive gas (level 5), visible before they detonate as low‑lying banks of thin, yellowish mist. If agitated, a gas pocket detonates, inflicting 5 points of damage on everything in the area, or 2 points on PCs who succeed on a Speed defense roll.
*   33–34: The character trips or is thrown from their vehicle or mount by a jolt or similar accidental incident, risking a broken bone on a failed difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.
*   35–36 (group): A before‑times radio transmission is received, asking anyone, anywhere, for aid.
*   37–38 (group): Mosquitos the size of hummingbirds attack.
    *   **Mosquitos, giant, swarm:** level 3; bite inflicts damage and, on failed Might defense roll, target contracts Nipah
*   39–40: The character steps in a bear trap left by other survivors. The PC takes 6 points of damage and is caught in a painful clamp until an ally succeeds on a difficulty 6 Might task to remove it.
*   41–42: The character stumbles over a decaying human corpse apparently killed by invasive fungus (level 3) eating through their brain.
*   43–44: The character ate something that didn’t agree with them, and becomes so afflicted with nausea that their tasks, attacks, and defense rolls are hindered by two steps for the next few hours.
*   45–46 (group): A mushroom cloud from a nuclear detonation blooms on the horizon. Are the PCs far enough away to survive? Maybe, if they find shelter pronto.
*   47–48: A mutated animal with unhealthy skin lesions and bulbous growths (with giant rat stats) scurries from the character’s backpack or other container when they stow or retrieve equipment. The animal runs off unless attacked, in which case it fights to the death.
*   49–50 (group): The PCs encounter a survivor claiming to be looking for a source of water that’s not radioactive. Maybe they’re telling the truth and could use some help. Or maybe they’re a spy from a nearby raider camp.
*   51–52: The thin trickle of water running through the ruins must be intermittently in contact with live electrical wires, as the character discovers when they take 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are stunned, losing their next turn.
*   53–54: A lurking rattlesnake bites the PC, then slithers off.
*   55–56 (group): When the PCs return to their camp or place of refuge, they find that someone else has stolen all their carefully hoarded stores and wrecked part of the camp.
*   57–58 (group): A pack of seven rabid dogs appears, growling and snarling.
    *   **Rabid dog:** level 3, attacks as level 4; Armor 1
*   59–60: The character falls partly (or completely) through the rotting floor, trapping their foot until they succeed on a difficulty 4 Might roll, or dropping them to a lower floor (and separating them from the others).
*   61–62 (group): It’s hot outside today, due to a combination of aberrant weather conditions. PCs without some means of cooling themselves off suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute in the “heat dome” covering the region.
*   63–64 (group): Eroded earth and dead vegetation in the region create perfect conditions for a sandstorm, which blows through the area for several hours, reducing visibility to an immediate distance.
*   65–66 (group): An electromagnetic storm rips through the area, knocking out any electronic devices the PCs might have, and potentially threatening PCs without shelter with a lightning strike (level 7).
*   67–68: An automatic defense system comes back online as PCs pass, deploying a metal‑clad pop‑up turret (level 5). Each minute, it targets the character with a mini‑missile attack that inflicts 10 points of damage (or 3 points even with a successful Speed defense roll).
*   69–70 (group): A group of three to six zombies (or cannibals, if your game has no zombies) stumbles out of the hospital, bunker, or old military facility.
*   71–72: The character’s trusty weapon finally rusts through or otherwise breaks.
*   73–74 (group): Seeping gas (level 4) in the area causes the PCs to begin hallucinating. Each is certain the other is some kind of threat—such as a raider, a zombie, or something else dangerous—until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll on their turn to realize what’s going on.
*   75–76 (group): The characters are caught in a stampede of rewilded giraffes, elephants, buffalo, or other large animals. Each PC suffers 3 points of damage, descends one step on the damage track, and on a failed difficulty 3 Speed defense roll, is borne along for a while and separated from their allies.
*   77–78 (group): The heavy rain and lightning storm suddenly births a tornado. PCs must seek shelter or suffer 7 points of damage each round they are exposed. If a PC takes enough damage to descend three steps on the damage track, they are pulled up into the vortex and lost.
*   79–80: The character discovers they’ve started growing a sixth finger on their left hand. Why? Maybe due to their previous exposures to whatever mutagen exists in the world, or for a reason yet to be learned.
*   81–82 (group): A before‑times jet appears in the sky, engines spewing smoke, before it crashes close enough to deal 4 points of damage to PCs that fail a difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.
*   83–84 (group): It begins to hail ice chunks the size of golf balls, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on PCs without shelter. The event also knocks any exposed vehicles or shelter the PCs rely on one step down the object damage track.
*   85–86: The character steps on a plant that releases spores blinding them for about a minute.
*   87–88: The character walks through a hidden trip wire set by other survivors, causing an alarm to blare.
*   89–90 (group): A group of people (level 2) with glazed eyes appear with gifts of food. They want to introduce the PCs to their AI benefactor (or warlord, if your game has no AIs) via an old‑time communications device they have with them.
*   91–92: The character has been pushing too hard and they’re exhausted; they move down one step on the damage track until after their next ten‑hour recovery.
*   93–94: Through misadventure, the character falls from the vehicle or mount, and no one else immediately notices.
*   95–96: A mutant skunk with two heads (or regular skunk, if your game doesn’t feature mutations) sprays the character. The character’s pleasant social interaction tasks are hindered by two steps for two to five days.
*   97–98 (group): NPC survivors demand PCs pay a toll to pass, equal to enough food and water to sustain one person for five days.
*   99–00 (group): The PCs arrive, but apparently their directions were wrong, because they’re not where they wanted to go, but someplace completely different.
