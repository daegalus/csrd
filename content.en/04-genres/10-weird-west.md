# Weird West

The weird west genre mixes the Old West frontier of the 1800s with supernatural elements—magic, monsters, and horror lurking in the dusty towns and trackless wilderness. Gunslingers face off against demons, alchemists animate forgeborn constructs, and cursed outlaws ride hellfire steeds across the prairie.

## Suggested Types For A Weird West Game

|         Role          | Type                                      |

|      Gunslinger       | Warrior                                   |
|        Lawman         | Speaker with combat flavor                |
|        Teacher        | Speaker                                   |

|      Prospector       | Explorer with combat flavor               |
|  Swindler or Gambler  | Explorer with stealth flavor              |
|   Doctor or Scholar   | Explorer with skills and knowledge flavor |
|  Alchemist/Engineer   | Adept with technology flavor              |

### Alternate Character Roles

If your setting is better described with a comparison "like the shows Firefly or Westworld but with X," you might consider an alternate slate of roles, possibly types suitable for a science fiction game where PCs can be pilots, scientists, technicians, and so on. Alternatively, a mix of both the roles noted here and those indicated for a science fiction game might work best for your game.

## Weird West Descriptors

In a weird west setting, as elsewhere, descriptors are designed to provide additional information about how and why characters take actions. Descriptors provide motivation and incentive, and place characters in the starting adventure.

**Standard Descriptors:** Grizzled, Laconic, Slick, Trailblazing, Trigger-Happy, Unforgiving, Wily

**Species Descriptors:** Forgeborn, Risen

### Species Advancement

The Forgeborn and Risen descriptors include suggestions for how to advance or improve a PC's inherent nature as that sort of creature (becoming even more forgeborn if you are a made being, for example). You can allow a character with such a descriptor to choose any of the indicated abilities (plus any others you feel are appropriate for the descriptor) in place of a type ability, either upon advancing to a new tier, or as a character advancement option in exchange for 4 XP.

### Forgeborn

Forgeborn—also called golems—are animate figures of metal, reanimated flesh, or other normally inert materials. Forgeborn are constructed for a specific purpose; their primary task is often to guard the alchemist that made them. As such, they usually ain't playing with a full deck when it comes to brains. You're different—somehow, you got a fully developed sense of self, and either never had or lost your compulsion to serve your maker. Maybe your alchemist creator emancipated you once they understood your animated form contained a fully realized mind, or maybe you ran away when the chance offered itself. Either way, you're on your own now, choosing your own goals and jobs.

Most folks who see you don't immediately realize you're not on the short leash of someone nearby. Maybe that's fine by you, since that keeps them from interfering in your business or asking too many pesky questions. Other times, you can't help it, and proudly proclaim your independent status to anyone and everyone.

Work with your GM to determine what materials you're made from and what you look like. But even if you're covered in metal, the nature of your particular construction is such that a bullet or blow is nearly as damaging to your workings as to normal flesh. On the other hand, healing magic is magic, and if any is to be had, it works as well on you as anyone else.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Durable:** +4 to your Might Pool.

**Skill:** You know your own kind. You are trained in tasks related to interacting with, identifying, tracking, or repairing other forgeborn.

**Resistant:** You gain two assets to defense rolls to resist effects that would daze or stun you, and you're immune to poison and disease.

**Fixable:** Even if you are killed, as long as all of your parts are collected, a willing alchemist who spends several days repairing you can bring you back with a successful difficulty 5 Intellect-based roll. However, the GM may decide you have some lasting damage, such as 2 fewer Pool points.

**Inability:** You're just not as quick as a living creature. Your Speed defense tasks are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Though it's not something they necessarily meant to do, the other PCs' actions gave you your independence, and they asked you along.
2. You were looking for a job, same as any other independent being, and applied to a job posting.
3. You're on the run from your creator, and the PCs' presence allows you to blend in.
4. You were lost. The PCs found you and invited you to join their group.

**Forgeborn Advancement:** Bash, Nothing but Defend, Enhanced Might, Enhanced Might Edge, Enlarge, Training in Unarmed Attacks

-----

### Grizzled

Life's thrown trials aplenty your way. Yet you're still here. Your skin is sun-kissed and weathered and your hair is streaked with gray, sure, but that just speaks to your resilience. You're seasoned—you've got the wisdom of long experience behind you. Your crinkled eyes only enhance your steely gaze, because you exude the quiet confidence of the battle-tested. 'Course, you've also learned the value of companionship, and your face easily breaks into a warm smile when your friends are nearby.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Experienced:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** You've seen your share of things. You are trained in local lore and history.

**Skill:** You've learned to see through folks' mendacity. You are trained in detecting falsehoods.

**Try, Try Again:** You don't give up easy. You don't have to spend a level of Effort the first time you retry a task, if you don't want to.

**Inability:** Your body ain't what it used to be. Your Might defense tasks are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Everything had gotten so boring, so you took the first opportunity that came up for some excitement.
2. You've worked with one of the PCs before, and they hired you again.
3. You mentored one of the other PCs—whether they remember it or not.
4. You're looking for someone, and the PCs' path happens to intersect with where you're looking.

-----

### Laconic

You're a soul of few words—or no words at all, when a shrug or nod will do. Now there's some who'll flap their jaws about everything that comes into their head. Sometimes they get under your skin. But you don't upbraid them; nope—you just frown. You're direct and to the point, avoiding elaboration. You're comfortable with pauses, and when you do speak, your words carry extra weight. All that said—and that's a hell of a lot more than you would say—you don't mind other folks. Just their prattle.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Deep Waters:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** You're not easily distracted. You're trained in perception tasks.

**Skill:** You've got a dry wit. You're trained in positive interaction tasks.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. When you didn't answer, everyone assumed you'd agreed to the job, and so here you are.
2. You lost your poker stake and now you need the money.
3. Of all the folks you've known, the PCs are the least annoying and most accepting of your stillness.
4. You were wrongfully fingered for a crime, and the PCs believed your side of the story.

-----

### Risen

You died. Now you're back. Except not completely—you're what them alchemists call a necrovore, or as regular folks whisper in your wake, Damned. And perhaps you do bear a sigil branded onto your flesh by a demon from Perdition. Maybe your situation is the result of some other curse that pulled you screaming back into animation. Or you might be called back from death due to your own need to finish a task you failed to accomplish before life fled.

Whatever the cause, you no longer breathe, your eyes dimly shine and blink only when you remember to, and your skin takes on an unnatural pallor.

**Sigil-Branded:** If your existence is a result of some strange demonic machination, you might bear a sigil that glimmers red as a coal. The sigil demonstrates that a power in Hell has laid claim to your soul. Maybe you know all about that demonic power and what tasks you must perform on its account, or not: where the sigil originated and what it portends might be as big a mystery to you as why you're back among the living in the first place.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Hell Hide:** +1 to your Armor.

**Deathless Resilience:** When you're debilitated, you can still act as if you were only impaired, even if your Speed is at 0. You're still killed if you descend three steps on the damage track.

**Sometimes You Come Back:** If you descend three steps on the damage track, you can spend 2 XP to return to animation at some point the GM chooses within the next few days.

**Stiff as Death:** You ain't as supple as you once was. Anytime you apply a level of Effort using Speed, it costs 1 additional point of Speed.

**Inability:** Something ain't right about you. Your positive interaction tasks and tasks related to interacting with animals are hindered.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. When everyone else ran away from you, the PCs stayed to learn more about your situation.
2. You saw the PCs struggling with a necrovore and decided to show them not all undead were bad.
3. The choice was between a half-life on the edges of society and joining the PCs' mission.
4. The PCs knew you before you died and wanted you back again even though your memories from back then are blurry.

**Risen Advancement:** Absorb Kinetic Energy, Improved Recovery, See the Unseen, Speaker for the Dead, Repair Flesh, Not Dead Yet

-----

### Slick

You've got a silver tongue. Some of that's down to natural talent, but your polished persona is mostly a product of constant practice. You've spent long hours mastering your ability to manipulate games of chance, run elaborate confidence games to get the better of your enemies, and hold yourself confidently. Plus, you've learned how to dress well—a well-turned-out individual is always taken more seriously, or such has been your experience, so you usually dress to impress.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Glib:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** You're trained in deception; you can apply this training to games of chance where an element of bluffing is involved, such as poker.

**Skill:** You're trained in all tasks involving positive or pleasant social interaction.

**Skill:** You're trained in all tasks involving identifying or assessing danger, lies, quality, importance, function, or power.

**Inability:** You do not willingly enter dangerous situations. Any initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat) are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a set of expensive clothing ideal for any occasion where you wish to dress to impress.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Sometimes your exploits create sore losers, and you joined the PCs hoping their presence would protect you.
2. You tried to fleece the PCs in a confidence game, but somehow you got caught up in their mission.
3. You realized the PCs' job might be especially lucrative and you invited yourself along.
4. You helped the PCs get out of trouble with the law by winning a bet with their jailer.

-----

### Trailblazing

You ain't afraid to explore badlands, high plains, or weirder locales. That's down to your pioneering spirit. Others like to stick close to what's known, but you like to ride out to see places others can't even imagine. Fear of the unknown is something you just don't understand; it's the known that makes you afraid. Spending too much time in one place makes you itchy and irritable. You live for the next time you're blazing a fresh trail, scouting a new territory, and coming around another bend just to see what's up ahead.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Hearty:** +2 to your Might Pool.

**Skill:** You're trained in wilderness navigation tasks, including finding your way through unknown locations.

**Skill:** You're trained in identifying creatures and plants, including cursed beasts and strange folk.

**Skill:** You're trained in perception tasks.

**Inability:** You're easily bored. Tasks requiring sustained attention of one or more minutes are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a hand compass.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. You were hired by the PCs to guide them to a strange location.
2. You have reason to believe that journeying with the other PCs will lead you to many more places unknown to you.
3. The one time you got in trouble out on your own, the PCs happened by and saved you.
4. You saw the PCs from afar, figured something interesting was happening, and wanted to be part of it.

-----

### Trigger-Happy

You're not just fast, you're lightning fast. Quick-thinking and nimble, you're swift to act in critical situations—chiefly, when you're in a showdown with another gunslinger. Some say you're a little too fast on the draw. But any time folks call you "trigger-happy" as if it's a put-down, you just smile, because they're burnishing your reputation. Your rapid reaction time comes in handy in all sorts of situations. 'Course, nothing is ever as important as putting a bullet in an opponent before they do the same to you.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Breakneck:** +2 to your Speed Pool.

**Skill:** You're trained in initiative tasks.

**Skill:** You're trained in Speed defense.

**Inability:** You may be fleet, but your Might defense rolls are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a light or medium pistol (your choice).

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Another PC was about to be gunned down and you saved them with a quick draw of your own.
2. One of the other PCs recruited you for your unique talents.
3. You hurt or killed someone important and had to get out of town, so you went with the PCs.
4. You showed up when and where you did on a dare—because, hey, you don't back down from dares.

-----

### Unforgiving

They done you wrong and you ain't gonna rest until they've paid the price. Maybe the crime or betrayal that befell you was long ago, and you've been looking for the perpetrators' trail ever since, with only limited luck. Or maybe it happened recently, when your life as you knew it ended. Did you lose a spouse? A child? A community?

You go about other tasks in the meantime, but you've become someone with an extra, underlying goal: vengeance. If you can only figure out who deserves it and/or where they're hiding, and/or maybe even who they are in the first place.

**Vengeance Achieved?** Work with your GM if you'd prefer this descriptor to be part of a revenge character arc. If so, vengeance may be something you can achieve and move on from, at which point it might be appropriate to change out your descriptor. Then again, you might have been Unforgiving so long that you're set in your ways.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Tragedy-Toughened:** +2 to your Might Pool.

**Skill:** You scare other folks. You're trained in intimidation tasks.

**Skill:** You've learned to tell when others shade the truth. You're trained in detecting falsehoods.

**Skill:** You're always on the lookout. You're trained in tracking tasks.

**Inability:** You don't care enough to be polite. Your positive interaction tasks are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You have an additional medium weapon.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. The other PCs are hunting the same outlaws as you, though they may have different reasons.
2. You found the PCs instead of the one(s) you're tracking, and they needed help.
3. It's something to do until you find another clue to help you along your path.
4. You have no idea how you joined the PCs. You're going along with it until a chance to gain vengeance presents itself.

-----

### Wily

You're a real sly dog if ever there was one. Quick-thinking and hard to cheat, folks would be plum foolish to take what you say at face value, 'cept for your friends, of course. You know how to work most any situation to your advantage. You're not so much a silver-tongued devil as you are a few steps ahead of whatever's about to happen.

Others rely on their looks or their charm to get ahead in the world, and you can't help but smirk when you consider their shortcomings. No sir, for you, it's all about that gray stuff between your ears.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Crafty:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** Always looking for an advantage, you're trained in all interactions involving lies or trickery.

**Skill:** Seeing things as they really are is the first step in outfoxing others. You're trained in perception tasks.

**Hunch:** When you apply a level of Effort using Intellect to a non-combat task, you can also choose to apply a free level of Effort once. The ability is restored after you make a recovery roll.

**Inability:** You pay a little too much attention, even to things you shouldn't. Your Intellect defense rolls are hindered.

**Additional Equipment:** You acquired an item another PC lost and thinks is gone for good. Now you have an additional expensive item, assuming you don't choose to give it back to the PC who lost it.

**Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1. Your wily plan convinced the other PCs to join your mission.
2. Although you won, your scheme angered nearby outlaws, and the PCs are the only reason you lived.
3. You told the PCs you would double their profits on their next job if they allowed you in on it.
4. You're one hundred percent certain the other PCs will fail if you don't come along.

## Optional Rules For The Weird West

### Playing Poker

The most obvious way you'd use physical cards in a Cypher System game is by actually playing a few rounds of poker (like Texas hold 'em, five-card draw, and so on), blackjack, faro, or some other card game when the characters have gotten themselves into an especially important in-world card game.

Usually, this means that you, the GM, will be standing in for one or more NPCs. The upshot is that every NPC poker player effectively has the same skill playing the game as you have, regardless of how good the NPC should be according to their stats.

#### Simulating NPC Poker Players

Hard-bitten gamblers who make their living at the card tables fall into individual styles. A handful of play styles are recognized, categorized by a cardplayer's tendencies at various stages during a particular hand.

**Ace:** This NPC is an expert player who understands the intricacies of the game, how to bluff, and how to read the other players. They're one of the best card sharks the PCs are ever likely to face. One way you can simulate this style of play is that you get two extra cards any time you draw cards for your hand, from which you can choose to make the best winning hand possible.

**Reasonably Skilled:** This NPC is pretty good. Good enough, anyhow, to keep playing the tables even after some bad hands. If you consider yourself such a player, you could just play the game as usual. However, if you're somewhat new to the game, give this NPC the benefit of one extra card any time you draw cards to your hand.

**Cheat:** This NPC is reasonably skilled at poker, but they also sometimes cheat. Give this NPC the benefit of one extra card any time you draw cards to your hand.

**Novice:** This NPC is just learning the game and really doesn't have the experience to know how to consistently win. Most novices are quickly cleaned out and lose their seat at the table unless they have an especially large chip advantage. If you're actually a better player than a novice, you'll have to handicap your play. That's easy enough; just don't choose the best hands and discard to lose, not win.

**Maniac:** An NPC "maniac" plays most hands, even with a weak hand, and usually bets as if they're going to win. This style leads to high variance, but in the long term, maniacs tend to lose lots of money. An easy way to simulate this style is just play that way; don't fold, always call or raise the bet, and stay in the game as if you've got a winning hand.

-----

### Hands of Fate

Introducing the Hands of Fate optional rule gives PCs a bit more control over their situation while further investing them in a weird west feel.

**Deal Fate's Hand:** At the beginning of each day (usually after players have completed a ten-hour recovery roll), deal each player two cards—these are their personal Hand of Fate cards. The hand doesn't exist in-world, but is instead a meta resource, to be used by the player for the benefit of their PC (sort of like XP).

**Draw Community Cards:** The first time the PCs have an encounter that day, draw three Hand of Fate community cards. These cards are placed face up on the table where all the players can see; all the players can use these community cards, combined with their personal Hand of Fate cards, to evaluate and eventually play their individual Hands of Fate. After you've dealt the first three community cards, draw and place one additional Hand of Fate community card each time a player triggers an intrusion or you intrude, until there are five community cards in total.

**Play a Hand of Fate:** After the first three Hand of Fate community cards are drawn, a player can, at any time, choose to play their Hand of Fate for the day, using any combination of personal and community cards. Their PC gains the benefit noted for their hand, or a lesser benefit:

- **Royal Flush** (an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 all of the same suit): PC gains one benefit below and can be dealt another Hand of Fate for the day.
- **Straight Flush** (five sequential cards, Aces high, all of the same suit): PC gains 1 XP (to keep or use like any XP).
- **Four of a Kind** (four cards of the same value): PC can immediately take an action, even if they've already acted this round.
- **Full House** (three of a kind and a pair): PC replaces a d20 roll (their own or another player's) with a 20.
- **Flush** (five cards of the same suit): PC can apply three free levels of Effort to any one roll.
- **Straight** (five sequential cards, Aces high, in sequence): PC can apply two free levels of Effort to any one roll.
- **Three of a Kind** (three cards of the same value): PC can apply a free level of Effort to any one roll.
- **Two Pair** (two cards of the same value, twice): PC regains 5 Pool points.
- **One Pair** (two cards of the same value): PC regains 3 Pool points.
- **High Card** (none of the above hands): PC regains 1 Pool point.

-----

### Curses of the Weird West

If you use this optional rule, hard-to-dispel curses exist in your setting.

Sometimes NPCs the PCs meet suffer from a curse, and that curse might confer upon them an unholy ability that makes it difficult for the PCs to deal with them. Other times, a PC might be cursed. Either way, PCs are probably interested in finding a way to break the curse.

**Cursed:** Some curses don't allow the character to make a defense roll to avoid them, especially if the character takes an action they know is wrong, such as killing an innocent, burning a bar, or tearing down a religious icon revered by many. But curses conferred on the PC by an NPC's attack should allow an appropriate defense roll. If a character is cursed, they know it when it happens—a weird feeling comes over them, all the hairs rise on their arms and neck, they feel as if "someone walked over their grave," or something similar. If the character is a PC, they should get 2 XP as a GM intrusion when the curse overtakes them (1 of which they'll give away, as normal).

**Breaking a Curse:** Breaking a curse is sometimes simple, and other times more complex.

- **Simple Curse Breaking:** Breaking a curse could be as straightforward as smashing, killing, dispelling, demolishing, or otherwise dealing with a physical object or creature that cursed the targeted character.
- **Complex Curse Breaking:** Some curses are more convoluted and require a specific course of action related to redressing the root transgression.

-----

### Tall Tales

Beginning at tier 3 or later, PCs have been active in the setting long enough that tall tales start being told about the group. That's especially true if the characters have interacted with NPCs who know a little about the characters and their exploits.

However, a tall tale grows in the telling. Whatever exploit is being recounted should include an exaggeration or two, if not at least one outright fabrication.

| d10 | Tall Tale |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | Raised by magical winds, the characters once roped a tornado to avert disaster. |
| 2 | The characters are able to grow to giant stature, such that lakes form in their footprints. |
| 3 | Hard-hearted survivalists, the characters avoided starvation by eating everyone else in town. |
| 4 | Able to invoke the elements, the characters mowed down a forest by blowing on it. |
| 5 | Raised by storms, the characters ride cyclones and dust devils instead of horses. |
| 6 | Keen-eyed as the sun, the characters can shoot a bull between the eyes from miles away. |
| 7 | Stronger than iron, the characters chewed through the steel bars to escape jail. |
| 8 | Able to outsmart privation, the characters wrung water from a wet rock. |
| 9 | Loud as thunder, the characters once killed an outlaw with their booming voices alone. |
| 10 | Heartless and cruel, the characters once drowned an entire mining camp just for sport. |

**Benefits of Tall Tales:**

- **Reputation:** When PCs are first recognized by NPCs familiar with the tall tale, PCs' very first interaction task (whether positive or negative) is eased by three steps. Future interaction tasks with the same NPCs are eased by one step.
- **Tall Tale Perks:** When PCs are recognized, people do favors for the characters. For instance, they can be seated at any card game, see the mayor at any hour, secure a seat on any train or coach, throw together a posse of enthusiastic folks, or get into any saloon or club, no matter how exclusive.
- **Retelling the Tale:** If the PCs wish, they can tell the tall tale from their own perspective. For as long as at least one PC is telling the story and listeners are not harmed, they keep the attention of all level 2 or lower NPCs who can hear them.

## Foci Of The Weird West

Because these new foci were created specifically for the weird west genre, each has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for being adapted to many different genres).

The GM and player should adjust focus details to suit the specific campaign.

### Blazes Paths

You read the land. You know every twisted arroyo, spiny cactus, and change in the weather. And what you don't know, you soon learn by sniffing the wind, tasting the dirt, and squinting across the wilderness landscapes. As you go, you mark the way for others to follow, notching trees or scribing stones with your personal symbol. As you become more and more accomplished, the network of trails you've blazed enhances not only your reputation as a pathfinder, but also your personal spiritual strength, allowing you to see what's happening along them, to flash along the miles you blazed in mere moments, and even return to the first time you ever set foot on a trail.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. For some reason, whenever that character stands right next to you, your navigation tasks are hindered.
2. Pick one other PC. You're not sure how they found out, but that character knows about the one time you got lost and couldn't find your way without help.
3. Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities triggers memories in them of having grown up someplace completely different than where they previously remembered. That memory is up to the other PC. If the memory is weird enough, they may want your help to find a way back there.
4. Pick one other PC. You found them close to death while you were blazing a path out in the wilderness. They either have no memory of what led them to that spot, or ended up there for a harrowing reason—it's up to that PC.

**Additional Equipment:** You have a hatchet, blue dye, and a brush—all equipment you use to blaze your trails in the wilderness.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You restore 2 points to your Speed Pool.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** An ally or indicated target can immediately move up to a short distance.

**Tier One:** Pathfinder Skills: You are trained in your choice of two of the following skills: blazing, navigation, perception, initiative, sensing danger, or tracking. You can choose this ability multiple times, but you must select different skills each time. Enabler.

**Tier Two:** Happy Trails: Whether you're traveling along a path you've previously marked, or you're navigating and blazing a new trail, roaming with you puts your companions at ease. During rests on any day you've traveled together, you and your party gain +1 to your recovery rolls. Enabler.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Trail Awareness or Trail Sensor as your tier 3 ability.

- *Trail Awareness:* Your connection with trails you've blazed is always with you. When traveling on, camping near, or within visual range of any trail you've blazed, you gain an asset on one attack or defense roll thanks to your knowledge about what else is using the path. Once used, this ability renews after your next recovery roll. Enabler.
- *Trail Sensor (3 Intellect points):* You imbue a newly created blaze symbol (or replace a blaze symbol you've previously created) with a spiritual connection to your mind's eye. For the next 24 hours, you can concentrate to see, hear, and smell through the sensor, no matter how far you move from it. If you also have a similar ability from another source, this effect lasts twice as long. The sensor doesn't grant you sensory capabilities beyond the norm. A few rounds to create the enhanced blaze symbol; action to check.

**Tier Four:** Blaze Door (5+ Intellect points): You can instantly transport yourself between two blaze symbols you've previously marked, as long as you use this ability while within immediate range of one of your symbols. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people within immediate range with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. Action.

**Tier Five:** Blaze Recovery: You gain an additional one-action recovery roll if you take it within long range of a blaze symbol you've made. Once you've used this ability, you can't use it again until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Step Across Time or Trail Cypher as your tier 6 ability.

- *Step Across Time (7+ Intellect points):* While you are within immediate range of any blaze symbol you've previously marked, you and up to three willing characters who are next to you travel to a point of your choosing earlier in time, when you were all traveling on the same trail the marker is part of or a connecting trail. When you appear in the past, you do so at the location you were along the trail then, replacing earlier versions of yourself in so doing. Upon arriving at your temporal destination, you and your fellow time travelers are stunned (and unable to act) for one minute. Using this ability is usually a one-way trip. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring additional people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. Action.
- *Trail Cypher:* Choose one cypher that you carry. The cypher must have an effect that is not instantaneous. You destroy the cypher and embed its power into a trail you've blazed. Any time you are on that trail or a connecting trail, you gain the effect of that cypher continuously. You can choose a cypher when you gain this ability, or you can wait and make the choice later. However, once you embed a cypher into your system of trails, you cannot later switch to a different cypher—the ability works only once. Action to initiate.

### Collects Bounties

You know just where to look to find the latest wanted posters. Each one that goes up on the side of the jail or the wall of the post office is potentially another job and another reward. But money's only half the deal—you also do it for the rush when you finally apprehend someone you've tracked across three territories. Some folks prefer to collect bounties without any undue fuss. But it wouldn't be fun if those you stalk don't put up a fight when you finally find them. And if it's a fight, well, they'd best watch themselves. Most bounties you take on are advertised as dead or alive. You'd prefer them alive so they can face justice, but if it's down to you or them, that's no choice at all.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. They accidentally provided information to a competing bounty hunter that lost you a quarry with a particularly lucrative reward.
2. Pick one other PC. You happened to see a few documents while tracking down something unrelated, which leads you to believe they're not exactly who they claim to be. You've since grown comfortable with them, but remain vigilant in case they turn out to be dangerous.
3. Pick one other PC. They rescued you from a train when outlaws blew it up, pulling you out of the wreckage at great risk to themself.
4. Pick one other PC. They know a secret story about your past that doesn't reflect especially well on your character. But back then, you were young and stupid. Not like today. Right?

**Additional Equipment:** Heavy leather duster (light armor).

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Your attack against a foe is eased.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** Make an immediate extra attack on your target.

**Tier One:**
- *Seek and Hide:* Tasks for tracking, looking for, or hiding from other creatures are eased. Enabler.
- *Know Where It Hurts:* You inflict 1 additional point of damage against targets you've successfully tracked, hidden from, used Overwatch on, or studied for one full action. Enabler.

**Tier Two:** Ignore the Pain: You ignore the impaired condition and treat the debilitated condition as impaired. Enabler.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Let Them Try or Surprise Attack as your tier 3 ability.

- *Let Them Try:* They usually don't give up without a fight. You are trained in Speed defense tasks. If your foe is someone you've successfully interacted with (as noted under Know Where It Hurts), your Speed defense tasks against them also gain an asset. Enabler.
- *Surprise Attack:* If attacking from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or before your opponent has acted, you get an asset on the attack. On a successful hit, you inflict 2 additional points of damage. Enabler.

**Tier Four:** Total Awareness: You possess such a high level of awareness that it's very difficult to surprise, hide from, or sneak up on you. When you apply a level of Effort to initiative and perception tasks, you gain two free levels of Effort. Enabler.

**Tier Five:** Free to Move: You ignore all movement penalties and adjustments due to terrain or other obstacles. You can fit through any space large enough to fit your head. You can apply three free levels of Effort to tasks involving breaking free of bonds, a creature's grip, or any similar impediment. Enabler.

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Greater Skill With Attacks or Lethal Damage as a tier 6 ability. Either way, you also gain Knock Out as a complementary tier 6 ability.

- *Greater Skill With Attacks:* Choose one type of attack, even one in which you are already trained: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. You are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. If you're already trained in that type of attack, you instead are specialized in that type of attack. Enabler.
- *Knock Out (5+ Might points):* You make a melee attack that inflicts no damage. Instead, if the attack hits, make a second Might-based roll. If successful, a foe of level 3 or lower is knocked unconscious for one minute. For each level of Effort used, you can affect one higher level of foe, or you can extend the duration for an additional minute. Action.
- *Lethal Damage:* Choose one of your existing attacks that inflicts points of damage (depending on your type and focus, this might be a particular pistol, a special ability such as a blast of fire, or your unarmed attacks). When you hit with that attack, you inflict an additional 5 points of damage. Enabler.

### Gambles It All Away

How long have you been haunting the card tables? Seems like a lifetime. You probably played your first hand of poker before you could even read words. People, though, were much easier to understand. You could always read other folks' tells, whether that's squinting, tapping, stammering, pulling at their earlobe, or any of a thousand other ways you know when to call their bluffs. Which is not to say you haven't walked away from the table in the hole. But you've always been able to make it up later. So far, anyway. Lately, you've been having weird dreams of loss and void. Is Lady Luck fixin' to turn her back on you? You hope not, because there ain't nothing in the world keeping you from gambling it all away.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. They beat you in a game of cards or dice when you totally thought you had them figured out. You befriended them rather than taking it personally (though it's possible you've won that and more back since).
2. Pick one other PC. Whenever they sit next to you, Lady Luck seems to notice. Sometimes your tasks are eased, other times hindered, and you never know ahead of time how things will go for a given game.
3. Pick one other PC. This character doesn't seem to care for how you make your living at the card tables.
4. Pick one other PC. When you were hurt by another gambler whose clock you cleaned, they stood up for you at great risk to themself.

**Additional Equipment:** A deck of especially fine playing cards.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** Your next gambling, wagering, or similar task is eased.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You win a wager.

**Tier One:**
- *Gambler:* You are trained in a table game in which you are not already trained. Choose from the following: poker, twenty-one, farro, craps, blackjack, roulette, baccarat, or another game where gambling on the outcome is part of play. Enabler.
- *Interaction Skills:* You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: deceiving, persuading, public speaking, seeing through deception, or intimidation. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler.

**Tier Two:** Courting Lady Luck: Maybe Lady Luck's watching over you and keeping you from harm, or maybe you're just damn lucky. When you would otherwise descend a step on the damage track, make an Intellect defense roll against the level of the foe or effect. If you succeed, you do not descend that step. If the step was because you fell to 0 points in a Pool, you are still at 0 points; you just don't suffer the negative effects of being impaired or debilitated. If you would otherwise descend the final step on the damage track to death, a successful defense roll keeps you at 1 point in one Pool, and you remain debilitated. Enabler.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Call Their Bluff or Card Genius as your tier 3 ability.

- *Call Their Bluff (3 Intellect points):* Are they bluffing or can they back up their claim? It doesn't really matter when you fix your stare on a target within long range. If your Intellect attack succeeds, the target suffers 2 points of ambient damage each round for one minute or until the target can throw off the effect (PC targets suffer Intellect damage). If you use your action on a subsequent round to fully concentrate on the target, their attempts to throw off the effect are hindered and they take 4 points of ambient damage that round. Action to initiate.
- *Card Genius:* The more you gamble, the sharper your mind becomes. You gain +5 to your Intellect Pool. Enabler.

**Tier Four:** Winning Hand (4 Intellect Points): If you win a hand of cards or other wager, or if you succeed on an Intellect defense roll to resist a foe's attack, you gain an action. You can use it immediately even if you have already taken a turn in the round. You can use this ability once per round. Enabler.

**Tier Five:** Consequences of Luck (5+ Intellect points): It used to be easier to be lucky all the time. Now, it takes a toll. When you roll a 1, you can reroll. If you reroll and roll a 1, 2, or 3, you must reroll again, this time expending a level of Effort plus the base Pool cost to activate this ability (5 Intellect points). If you roll a 1–5 on the second reroll, you must reroll again, expending a level of Effort and spending the base cost again (5 Intellect points), too. This progression of forced rerolls coupled with an increasing failure range continues until you roll higher than the failure range or you run out of Intellect points. (If the target number you roll is below the failure range, you might succeed on the task, but the forced-rerolling continues.) Enabler.

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Fate Breaker or Gambling God as your tier 6 ability.

- *Fate Breaker:* Something beyond your ken takes an interest in you. If you fail on a task (including an attack or a defense), you can change the die result to a natural 20. (That still might not be enough to succeed if the difficulty is higher than 6.) This ability doesn't work if you roll a natural 1 for an attempted task, unless you reroll using Consequences of Luck and obtain a result that isn't in the failure range. Once you use this ability, it is not available again until after you make a ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.
- *Gambling God:* Any time you use Effort on an Intellect action, add one of the following enhancements to the action (your choice): Free level of Effort, or Automatic minor effect. Enabler.

### Hits The Saloon

The saloon is an old friend, whether or not you visit the same one twice. Whatever the name on the sign out front, the pungent smells of whiskey, cigars, and sawdust lift your spirits like nothing else. 'Cept for actual spirits, of course. When that first shot hits your throat and sets a warm blaze in your belly, you can't keep a smile from your lips. This here's your home away from home, and inside are your friends, both old and those soon to be made. Though not everyone's happy to see you—troublemakers soon learn that in a scrap, you only hit harder with each shot of whiskey you pour down your throat.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. This character has spent a lot of time with you saloon-hopping. Once between any ten-hour rest, you gain an additional asset when you collaborate on the same task, fight the same foe, and so on.
2. Pick one other PC. You saw them get their ass whooped in a saloon fight once, though they didn't know you saw it. You can choose whether or not to share that information.
3. Pick one other PC. You and this character once had a terrible drunken argument that neither of you remember exactly, but neither can you let it go. Once between any ten-hour rest (when the GM chooses), an action is hindered when you collaborate on the same task, fight the same foe, and so on.
4. Pick one other PC. This character has still never visited your favorite saloon, and you've promised to take them one day. Whether or not the character is interested is up to them.

**Additional Equipment:** You carry a sturdy, leak-proof metallic whiskey flask.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You don't have to use an action to activate your next Jovial Presence ability.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You remember something a stranger in a saloon once said, and you can ask the GM one question about what you're looking at.

**Tier One:**
- *Jovial Presence (2 Intellect points):* You observe or study a creature, object, or location for at least one round. The next time you interact with it (possibly in the following round), a related task (such as persuading the creature, attacking it, or defending from its attack) is eased. If you're in a saloon, the task is eased by two steps. Action.
- *Enthusiastic Listener:* You pick up stuff listening to folks gab in the bar. You are trained in one area of knowledge of your choice. Enabler.

**Tier Two:**
- *Blitzer:* You inflict 2 additional points of damage with unarmed attacks, or 3 points when you are one or more steps down the intoxication track. Enabler.
- *Liquid Courage:* Your defense rolls against fear are eased. They are eased by two steps when you are one or more steps down the intoxication track. Enabler.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Iron Stomach or Skill With Attacks as your tier 3 ability.

- *Iron Stomach:* The more you imbibe, the greater your tolerance grows (at least, so far...). You gain +5 to your Might Pool. Enabler.
- *Skill With Attacks:* Choose one type of attack in which you are not already trained, such as unarmed attacks (though you could also select weapon options like light bashing, light bladed, and so on). You are trained in that kind of attack. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose a different type of attack. Enabler.

**Tier Four:** Bottle KO (5+ Might points): You make a melee attack that inflicts no damage. Instead, if the attack hits, make a second Might-based roll. If successful, a foe of level 3 or lower is knocked unconscious for one minute. For each level of Effort used, you can affect one higher level of foe, or you can extend the duration for an additional minute. If you use a whiskey bottle to make the attack, your attack is eased. If you have a similar sort of knockout ability from another source (such as your type), the attack is eased by an additional step. Action.

**Tier Five:** Learned a Few Things Over Drinks: You are trained in two areas of knowledge of your choice, or specialized in one area of knowledge of your choice. Enabler.

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Inspiration in a Glass or Lethal Damage as your tier 6 ability.

- *Inspiration in a Glass (6+ Intellect points):* You meditate, perhaps over a drink, perhaps on a fond memory you made in a saloon or similar enjoyable location. You gain a level 6 subtle cypher of the general variety that you want (though the GM chooses the specifics) and can use it next round. If you are already at your cypher limit when you use this ability, choose which cypher you replace with the new one. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the cypher's level; each level of Effort used in this way increases the level by 1. Action.
- *Lethal Damage:* Choose one of your existing attacks that deals damage (depending on your type and focus, this might be a specific weapon, your unarmed attacks, or maybe a bottle of whiskey). When you hit with that attack, you inflict an additional 5 points of damage. Enabler.

### Rides Like The Wind

Few things feel more empowering than when you jump into the saddle and ride! Maybe you have a special mount called Thunder, Caballo, Dusty, or a name you don't share with others. Or perhaps any mount will serve, because you're just that skilled in the saddle. Whatever the case, when you and your mount are moving, other folks say they have a hard time figuring where one of you stops and the other begins—you act as a single creature that almost nothing can stop.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. You promised that character a ride anywhere they wanted to go on your mount. They haven't yet taken you up on your offer.
2. Pick one other PC. You rode them to safety after they got in trouble with the law. Trouble hasn't found you because of it. Yet.
3. Pick one other PC. That character was hired to kill you, but they didn't, because they like your mount.
4. Pick one other PC. Due to a misunderstanding of identity, you rode them down once. They still have a scar, but it's up to them whether they hold it against you.

**Additional Equipment:** A mount plus riding gear including saddle, bridle, and stirrups.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You restore 2 points to your Speed Pool or 2 health to your mount.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You can take a second action this round.

**Tier One:**
- *Rider:* You are trained in riding any kind of creature that commonly serves as a mount in the setting. Enabler.
- *Trick Rider:* You can make an attack with a light or medium ranged weapon and attempt a riding task as a single action. Riding tasks could be as straightforward as keeping up with a fleeing foe or as tricky as hanging upside down beneath your galloping mount, standing upright on the saddle of your galloping mount, and so on. Enabler.

**Tier Two:** Supernatural Jump (4 Speed points): You can use this ability in one of two ways. If you're on your mount, you can move a long distance from one location to another almost instantaneously, carried by the creature you ride. You must be able to see the new location, and there must be no intervening barriers. Alternatively, you can use this ability to summon your mount from wherever it happens to be, leap up into the saddle, and use Trick Rider to make an attack or attempt a riding task. (Your mount can usually reach you even if you are deep underground, high in the air, or in another dimension, because your connection to your mount transcends the natural.) Action.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Enhanced Speed Edge or Nimble in the Saddle as a tier 3 ability. Either way, you also gain Expert Rider as a complementary tier 3 ability.

- *Enhanced Speed Edge:* You gain +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.
- *Expert Rider:* You are specialized in all tasks related to riding a mount, including those pertinent to the care and healing of your mount. Enabler.
- *Nimble in the Saddle:* Whether in the saddle or not, you've developed amazing reflexes. You're trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

**Tier Four:** Gallop Across the Sky (4+ Speed points): Your ride your mount into the air and fly for one minute at a rate of up to a long distance each round. For each level of Effort you apply, you can increase the duration of the effect by one minute or carry one ally of about your size with you that will also fit on your mount. Action to initiate.

**Tier Five:** Dangerous When Mounted: When you attack from your saddle, you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Ride Across the Miles or Tornado Ride as your tier 6 ability.

- *Ride Across the Miles (6+ Speed points):* You can ride your mount to an open location on the planet that you're familiar with almost instantaneously. If you apply a level of Effort, you can attempt to penetrate covered locations that you're aware of as long as a route exists from the open air to the area you want to reach. Action.
- *Tornado Rider (7 Speed points):* Your mount's flashing hooves churn up a small tornado, lifting you and your mount a long distance into the eye of the supernatural storm. The tornado moves as you direct it up to a short distance each round for up to five minutes or until you dismiss it. The swirling winds damage creatures, objects, and structures within short range of the tornado's eye. Each round, creatures in the area take 3 points of damage due to debris on the wind. Attempts to damage objects or structures with your tornado are eased by two steps. Action to initiate.

### Spits Fire And Lead

You once crossed paths with a fiery demon, learned a bit of blazecraft from an alchemist, or maybe just always had a special talent for starting fires. That and your love of letting your six-shooters bark combine to make you the feared gunfighter that you are today. You might have developed a reputation already as you move between plains and badlands, using your uncanny skills to avenge, promote justice, or just enrich yourself. Whatever the case, it's how you'll acquit yourself when, inevitably, you draw your burning iron.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. This character also likes fire. You both deal 1 additional point of damage when you fight the same foe using fire.
2. Pick one other PC. You're certain this character appreciates your smoldering gun and is impressed by how well you shoot. This may or may not actually be the case.
3. Pick one other PC. They quietly think you're either a demon or kin to demons. How they feel about demons is up to them.
4. Pick one other PC. You failed to protect this character at some point in the past, and you feel compelled to make up for your failure.

**Additional Equipment:** A six-shooter (medium or heavy weapon) and 20 rounds of ammunition.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You graze a target so that their tasks are hindered next round.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** The target ignites, taking 2 points of damage from fire each round for three rounds (or until they or an ally use an action to douse the flame).

**Tier One Type Swap:** If you wish, you can swap one or two abilities gained from your type for one or two of the following. Ask your GM what reloading rules are like for pistols before choosing Reload.

- *Cogent Shot:* You can spend points from either your Speed Pool or your Intellect Pool to apply Effort to hit a target with a gun or increase the damage inflicted doing so. Enabler.
- *Reload (1 Speed point):* When using a weapon that normally requires an action to reload, you can reload and fire (or fire and reload) in the same action. Enabler.

**Tier One:**
- *Smoldering Gun (1 Intellect point):* Your gun blazes with flame for ten minutes, glowing red and discharging a tendril of smoke from the barrel. The flames don't burn you, but you inflict 1 additional point of damage with the gun while it burns. While the gun burns, it automatically flares when anyone tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack, dealing 2 points of damage to them. Flames from another source can still hurt you. While your gun smolders, you gain +1 Armor against damage from fire from another source. Enabler.
- *Practiced With Guns:* You are practiced with guns and suffer no penalty when using one. Enabler.

**Tier Two:** Summon Gun (3 Intellect points): If you're ever without your six-shooter, you can summon it (or another just like it) instantly to your hand, already loaded. Enabler.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Meticulous Aim or Quickdraw as your tier 3 ability.

- *Meticulous Aim:* If you spend an action lining up your shot while Smoldering Gun is active, each level of Effort adds 5 points of damage to a successful attack instead of 3. Enabler.
- *Quickdraw:* If you act first and your firearm is holstered, you can draw and fire your weapon so blindingly fast that you gain a surprise action against your foe, even if your foe was already aware of your presence (but not if combat has already begun). This doesn't allow your allies to act with surprise, only you. You have an asset on the attack. On a successful hit, you inflict 2 additional points of damage. Enabler.

**Tier Four:** Blazing Bullets (1+ Intellect points): While Smoldering Gun is active, you inflict an additional 3 points of damage with your chosen weapon (+4 points of damage total). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, applying a level of Effort can cause the bullet to explode on impact, potentially dealing damage to all creatures in immediate range of your target; roll an attack for each separately. Even if you miss, you still deal 1 point of damage with fiery lead shrapnel. Enabler.

**Tier Five:** Forgeborn Bullet (5 Intellect points): Your fired bullet blooms into a fiery forgeborn with a somewhat humanoid appearance that does your bidding for up to ten minutes. (You can't summon a forgeborn and attack with the same bullet.) After its task is complete, you dismiss the fiery forgeborn as part of another action, or if it is destroyed, it implodes back into a smoldering bullet. Action to initiate.

*Fiery forgeborn:* level 4; anyone who tries to touch or strike the forgeborn with a melee attack automatically takes 1 fire damage

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Hot Shot or Never Miss a Shot as your tier 6 ability.

- *Hot Shot:* When you hit a target with a gun attack while Smoldering Gun is active, you can choose to reduce the damage by 1 point but gain an additional related effect and/or hit a target in a precise spot. Possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following: You can ignite a structure (if you succeed on an Intellect-based task against its level). You can create a flaming message in the sky consisting of a handful of words that lasts for up to a minute. You can shoot an object out of someone's hand. You can shoot the leg, wing, or other limb your target uses to move, reducing their maximum movement speed to immediate for a few days or until they receive expert medical care. You can shoot a strap holding a backpack, armor, or a similarly strapped-on item so that it falls off. Enabler.
- *Never Miss a Shot:* If you shoot at a target and miss, reroll. If you hit, it's because your shot ricochets off a nearby surface and actually hits, inflicting 2 fewer points of damage. Each time you reroll the same shot, 2 more points are deducted from the total damage, until the wildly ricocheting shot finally hits its target or the damage amount goes to 0. Enabler.

-----

### Strikes Like A Rattler

Your body is a venomous weapon able to cripple and kill. Watchful as a coiled rattlesnake, you're ready to evade an attacker, then strike back with fists, elbows, knees, or feet that sink into flesh with the speed of fangs. Fact is, you've got a supernatural connection to venomous serpents, the rattler in particular. That spiritual fusion empowers you both offensively and defensively, maybe even eventually giving you power over snakes, or allowing you to become a serpent avatar after shedding your skin.

**Connection:** Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1. Pick one other PC. You rescued this character from a bad situation, but in doing so, you killed someone close to the character. Maybe that was also the PC's persecutor, but there's still some tension between you.
2. Pick one other PC. You were once given a package to deliver to them from a mysterious source, but you lost the package before you were able to hand it over.
3. Pick one other PC. You accidentally envenomated them when they shook you awake or otherwise startled you. How they feel about that now is up to them.
4. Pick one other PC. They owe you a significant amount of money.

**Minor Effect Suggestion:** You make yourself a target, easing your allies' defense rolls until your next turn.

**Major Effect Suggestion:** You get a second wind and can make an immediate recovery roll that doesn't count against your regular number of recovery rolls today.

**Tier One Type Swap:** If you wish, you can swap an ability gained from your type for the following.

- *Swift Slither (1+ Speed points):* You can move a short distance as part of another action. You can move a long distance as your entire action for a turn. If you apply a level of Effort to this ability, you can move a long distance and make an attack as your entire action for a turn, but the attack is hindered. Enabler.

**Tier One:**
- *Venomous Strike (1+ Speed points):* For ten minutes, your unarmed attacks inflict 1 additional point of damage (ignores Armor) from venom. Enabler.
- *Scaled (1+ Speed points):* For one hour, your skin grows subtle, supple scales in vulnerable places, granting you +1 to Armor if you do not wear physical armor. Action to initiate.

**Tier Two:**
- *Unarmed Fighting Style:* You are trained in unarmed attacks, assuming you're not already (because this ability provides no benefit if you are). Enabler.
- *Snake Charmer (1+ Intellect points):* You calm an ophidian creature within short range. You must speak to it (though it doesn't need to understand your words), and it must see you. It remains calm for one minute or for as long as you focus all your attention on it. The GM has final say over what counts as a snakelike creature, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect it before you attempt to use this ability on it. If you spend 1 additional Intellect point when you use this ability, you can calm all nonhuman beasts, as the GM determines (aliens, demons, animals that can speak, and forgeborn never count). Action.

**Tier Three:** Ability Choice: Choose either Gain Rattler Companion or Stupefying Rattle as your tier 3 ability.

- *Gain Rattler Companion:* You gain a supernatural rattlesnake—a dust diamondback—as a constant companion. It is over 10 feet (3 m) long and follows your psychic commands. You'll probably make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions (or it can ease your attacks or your defenses in combat). The companion acts on your turn. If your companion dies, you can hunt in the badlands for a few days to find a new one. Enabler. *Dust diamondback:* level 3, Speed defense as level 4; health 12; bite deals 3 damage plus 1 Speed damage (ignores Armor) on a failed Might defense roll
- *Stupefying Rattle (4 Speed points):* With a slithering flourish and a ghost rattle echoing from some otherworldly source, you redirect a melee attack that would otherwise hit you if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Speed task. When you do, the misdirected attack hits another creature you choose within immediate range of both you and the attacking foe. Enabler.

**Tier Four:** Warmed by the Sun (2 Intellect points): After spending ten minutes in the sun, a hot spring, or other such warm location, you gain a free ten-minute recovery roll. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. Ten minutes to activate.

**Tier Five:** Venom in Their Blood (5 Speed points): If you successfully attack a creature that you previously damaged with Venomous Strike, you deal 9 additional points of damage. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again during the current conflict. Enabler.

**Tier Six:** Ability Choice: Choose either Shed Skin or Spray Venom as your tier 6 ability.

- *Shed Skin (7+ Speed points):* You shed your normal likeness, revealing a terrifying 30-foot (9 m) long rattlesnake. For one minute, your abilities change as follows: You add 8 points to your Speed Pool, 1 point to your Speed Edge, 2 points to your Intellect Pool, and 1 point to your Intellect Edge; and you gain the "air gliding" ability (you can fly a long distance each round). After reverting to your normal form, you lose the benefit of air gliding, your Edge values return to normal, and you must subtract the same number of points you gained in your Pools (if this brings a Pool to 0, subtract the overflow first from your Might Pool, then your Speed Pool, and then, if necessary, from your Intellect Pool). While the ability was active, if you did not deal damage with Venomous Strike, your rolls are hindered by two steps until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. Each additional time you use Shed Skin before your next ten-hour recovery roll, you must apply an additional level of Effort. Action to initiate.
- *Spray Venom (5+ Speed points):* You hiss and release a spray of burning, flesh-dissolving venom at one target within short range, inflicting 5 points of damage. Even on a miss, you inflict 1 point of damage. If you apply a level of Effort when you make an attack with this ability (either to increase the odds of hitting or to increase damage), you can also choose to spin about as you spray venom, attacking every creature you choose within short range, and the improved chance to hit or deal damage applies to each attack. As with the base use, even on a miss, you inflict 1 point of damage. However, spinning as you spray venom is dizzying, leaving you dazed for a round afterward, during which time all your tasks are hindered. Action.

## Paranormal Vices Of The Weird West

Fair warning, pardner—if you ain't careful, grifters, drunkards, and rabble-rousers will drag you to Perdition. 'Cept some folks never seem to suffer from their own impure actions—and not even they really know why.

A vice is behavior that many consider immoral or wicked. In some times and places, one person's vice is another's completely healthy pastime, if not taken to an extreme. But taking it to the extreme is what vices in the weird west rely on to empower them.

Characters that lean into vice in a weird west setting gain advantages above and beyond mere pleasure in the pursuit of their debauchery. One of those advantages is seeming immunity from the downsides such degeneracy eventually exacts on longtime indulgers. At least, they evade consequences for a lot longer than seems possible, until the force the PCs have unintentionally connected themselves to decides otherwise.

**NPCs With Paranormal Vices:** It could turn out that PC activity is too "pure" to warrant a mystical connection to invisible forces of oblivion, entropy, lies, and so on. In that case, the PCs might well encounter the rare NPC that always at least breaks even in poker (a Cardsharp), can drink anyone under the table and only seem steadier and more unflinching (an Inebriate), or can talk someone else out of their hat and spurs and be thanked for it (a Shyster).

### Paranormal Vice Origins

How an indulged vice imbues the devotee with inhuman power is not well understood, even by the few alchemists aware of the phenomenon. The current hypothesis is that indulging a vice acts like a ritual of worship that connects someone with a primordial avatar or power. These mysterious mystic forces lie on the edges of existence, normally hidden in the deeps of time.

### Developing a Paranormal Vice

A PC might develop a paranormal vice in a manner similar to one of the ways a character can become cursed—as a result of poor choices. In this case, ongoing dedication to drinking, gambling, or swindling might forge a linkage to an invisible force related to the individual activity. A force that encourages that vice, knowing that with continued use, the pinhole connection it's forged to the world will grow.

When a character gains a vice with ties to a primordial power source, the character knows it. The revelation comes to them as a sort of waking dream where they see a version of themself cloaked in flame, shadow, ice, blades, or some other dramatic energy, standing ascendent while engaging in their vice. It feels like a promise of future glory. And with that promise, the character gains some understanding about how their paranormal vice functions.

### Mechanics of a Paranormal Vice

There are positives and negatives associated with a paranormal vice.

**Paranormal Abilities:** A character with a paranormal vice gains additional abilities via their connection to a primordial power, as noted under each vice. Make just a couple of the indicated abilities available to the character initially, but give them one more each time they increase their connection with a low connection roll.

**Repercussions From a Connection:** Over time, a connection grows between a character's paranormal vice and the mysterious force behind it. Repercussions sometimes manifest depending on the character's connection roll.

**Connection Roll:** Each time a character with a paranormal vice uses one of their abilities, they must make 1d10 connection roll. On a connection roll of 1, the connection range increases by 1, and the character suffers a repercussion. For instance, if a character rolls a 1, the next time they make a connection roll, a connection occurs on a roll of 1–2. If a connection is made, the associated repercussion occurs immediately (but the character also gains the benefit of the ability that triggered it during the same period, if applicable).

If the connection range reaches 1–6, the character suffers the final repercussion.

Repercussions and final repercussions are noted under each paranormal vice.

-----

### Drinking

A person with this vice is called an **Inebriate**.

Libations are celebrations in a glass for some, fortitude and confidence for others, or both at once. Best not to be stingy with the liquor! For an Inebriate, alcohol means transcending everyday existence. Graced by the spirits consumed, inhibitions dissolve and the Inebriate is set adrift on a sea of euphoria—or, for some, unstoppable rage.

**Related Vices:** A character who overindulges in some other drug—like laudanum, opium, tobacco, and patent medicines like "Doctor Good" (derived from cocaine, opium, and alcohol)—could gain a paranormal vice with the same characteristics as an Inebriate.

#### Ill Effects of Drinking

Someone who drinks too much in the short term descends one or more steps on the intoxication track. (Someone who drinks too much in the longer term risks alcoholism, liver disease, cancer, and an early death.)

#### Intoxication Track

The intoxication track has five states: sober, tipsy, inebriated, passed out, and hungover.

Each time a character has more than one drink in an hour, they must succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, they descend a step on the track (except as noted). The difficulty of the Might defense roll starts at 3, increasing by 1 for each additional drink taken during the same hour, or while the character is down one or more steps on the intoxication track.

- **Sober** is the normal state for characters who haven't been drinking and who aren't hungover.
- **Tipsy** characters are those who've started to feel one or two drinks. Tipsy characters can apply a free level of Effort to positive social interaction tasks, but must spend 1 extra point per level of Effort applied to any other task. If a tipsy character has no more drinks, they return to sober in about an hour and probably won't become hungover.
- **Inebriated** characters' tasks are hindered by two steps. Inebriated characters must spend 1 extra point per level of Effort applied to any task. The GM should also intrude on an inebriated character at least once. If an inebriated character has no more drinks, they return to sober in about three hours and must succeed on a Might defense roll against a difficulty of 3 + the number of drinks consumed. On a failure, the character instead moves to the hungover step.
- **Passed out** means a character is unconscious, or as good as. A passed-out character won't revive on their own for four to eight hours. When they do revive, they descend the track to hungover. Characters who passed out don't remember what happened while they were inebriated.
- **Hungover** characters feel horrible and their tasks are hindered. A hangover lasts six to twelve hours, or until a character has "hair of the dog" (at least one drink).

#### Inebriate Abilities

An Inebriate gains the following abilities, drawn from some inscrutable, invisible source. Make just a couple of the indicated abilities available initially, but give them one more each time they increase their connection with a low connection roll.

**Triggering Inebriate Abilities:** Some Inebriate abilities require the Inebriate to throw back a drink (as part of the same action, or as a separate action, as noted) to gain the effect. Each time an ability is used (including enablers), the Inebriate must roll 1d10 to check for a connection.

- **Deadeye:** For ten minutes, the Inebriate eases ranged attacks. Drink (separate action) to activate.
- **Hair-Trigger Reflexes:** The Inebriate adds a free level of Effort to initiative tasks. Enabler.
- **Iron Liver:** When they wish, an Inebriate doesn't suffer ill effects of alcohol, including descending steps on the intoxication track. Enabler.
- **Mean Drunk:** For one minute, the Inebriate's ranged attacks deal 1 additional point of damage. Drink (part of same action) to activate.
- **Unflinching:** For ten minutes, the Inebriate gains +1 to Armor and eases Might defense rolls by two steps. For the same period, the Inebriate gains one extra step on the damage track called hurt, which is effectively the same as hale but a bit rougher looking. Drink (separate action) to activate.

#### Inebriate Repercussions

| d6 | Repercussion |
|----|--------------|
| 1 | **Blind in One Eye.** The character loses vision from one eye for one hour. During this period, a burning, alien eye looks out from the character's eye socket instead of their own, and their sight-based tasks are hindered. |
| 2 | **Liquor Purge.** All the alcohol the character carries or touches for the next hour turns to dust—the character can't benefit from Inebriate abilities for that hour. |
| 3 | **Infectious Intoxication.** A nearby ally descends one step on the intoxication track. While the ally remains intoxicated, the character can't look at them or say their name. |
| 4 | **Worm From the Bottle.** The character can't speak for ten minutes. Instead, an echoing voice that sounds like dark liquid rushing down a waterfall laughs and threatens others. |
| 5 | **Rampage.** A drunken rage overtakes the character; they must attack the closest creature each round until they succeed on a difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll. |
| 6 | **Retching Summons.** Character upchucks a horrific mass that animates as an insidious thing (level 5; health 18) that attacks everyone. |
| Final | Character vanishes, leaving behind clothing and possessions sopping wet with rancid whiskey. This summons an avatar of oblivion into the physical world. |

-----

### Gambling

A person with this vice is called a **Cardsharp**.

The promise of untold riches lies beyond the next card flip, dice roll, or spin of the wheel. Why sleep when one could be playing a game with a huge pot? For a Cardsharp, cards are weapons and dice are life. The whims of fate are nothing against their seemingly infallible luck.

**Related Vices:** Cardsharps are usually cardplayers (or dice players). But anyone who bets on the outcome of some event, such as stagecoach races, showdowns, or even flips of a coin might do it often enough to connect to the otherworldly and gain a paranormal vice.

#### Cardsharp Abilities

A Cardsharp gains the following abilities, drawn from some inscrutable, invisible source. Make just a couple of the indicated abilities available initially.

**Triggering Cardsharp Abilities:** Some Cardsharp abilities require flipping a coin, card, or die (as part of the same action, or a separate action) to gain the effect. Each time an ability is used, the Cardsharp must roll 1d10 to check for a connection.

- **Breaking Even:** When they wish, a Cardsharp doesn't walk away from a game or bet having lost any money. Enabler.
- **Cardsharp's Luck:** When the Cardsharp rolls for a task and succeeds, they roll again. If the second number is higher, they get a minor effect. If they roll the same number, they get a major effect. Enabler.
- **Deck to Hand:** The Cardsharp gains a new deck of cards, dice, or other gambling token required for the game at hand. Action.
- **Entropy's Luck:** If the Cardsharp fails on a task, they can change the die result to a natural 20; however, a repercussion is automatically triggered. Enabler.
- **Shuffle Wizard:** For ten minutes, the Cardsharp gains +1 to Speed Edge and eases Speed defense rolls by two steps. Tasks to distract onlookers by card manipulation are also eased by two steps. Draw card or flip coin (separate action) to activate.

#### Cardsharp Repercussions

| d6 | Repercussion |
|----|--------------|
| 1 | **Stone Hand.** The character loses the use of one hand for one hour. Physical tasks requiring two hands are hindered. |
| 2 | **Card Fire.** Cards, dice, coins, and similar material within immediate range burst into flames, dealing 5 points of ambient damage to creatures in immediate range. |
| 3 | **Loser.** A nearby ally loses big on a bet, and the Cardsharp forgets that ally's existence for an hour. |
| 4 | **Joker.** For one hour, anything the Cardsharp says concludes with a threat of horrific violence. |
| 5 | **Ace of Guns.** A bullet from a distant gunfight ricochets into the area, attacking the Cardsharp and up to five nearby people as a level 5 attack. |
| 6 | **Queen of Gears.** A nearby mechanism animates as a forgeborn (level 4; Armor 2; two attacks) that attacks everyone. |
| Final | Character vanishes, leaving behind clothing and possessions. This summons an avatar of entropy into the physical world. |

-----

### Swindling

A person with this vice is called a **Shyster**. They're tricksters whose honeyed words are so potent that those who've been duped often refuse to believe anything other than the beautiful tapestry of fiction.

#### Shyster Abilities

A Shyster gains the following abilities, drawn from some inscrutable, invisible source.

**Triggering Shyster Abilities:** Some Shyster abilities require a minor tell such as a wink, raised eyebrow, or quick quirk of the mouth (as part of the same action). Each time an ability is used, the Shyster must roll 1d10 to check for a connection.

- **Convincing Lie:** For ten minutes, the Shyster gains +1 to Intellect Edge and eases Intellect defense rolls by two steps. Deception tasks are eased by two steps. Wink (part of same action) to activate.
- **Evade All Consequence:** A mark who finally realizes they've been conned doesn't come looking for revenge if the Shyster doesn't want them to. Enabler.
- **Quick Thinking:** If a Shyster succeeds on an Intellect defense roll, they gain an action they can use immediately. Enabler.
- **Shyster's Face:** The Shyster's face reforms in some other guise, granting two assets to disguise tasks for one hour. Wink (part of same action) to activate.
- **Won't Be Fooled Again:** For the next day, the Shyster isn't conned by someone else's grift. Wink (as an action) to activate.

#### Shyster Repercussions

| d6 | Repercussion |
|----|--------------|
| 1 | **Unbroken Skin.** The character can't speak for one hour—their mouth and vocal cords simply don't exist. |
| 2 | **Banned Words.** Something the Shyster says evokes a primordial word of power, dealing 5 points of Intellect damage to everyone within audible range. |
| 3 | **Swindled by Reality.** An important piece of equipment goes missing, stolen by a manifestation of lies. |
| 4 | **The Truth Hurts.** For a few hours, speaking truth causes 2 points of Intellect damage and everyone hears a lie instead. |
| 5 | **Truth Spasm.** For a few hours, anyone speaking truth near the Shyster suffers 2 points of Intellect damage and horrific visions. |
| 6 | **Ghostly Retribution.** A ghost of someone who died on account of lies is summoned and attacks everyone. |
| Final | Character vanishes, leaving behind clothing and possessions but no identifying items. This summons an avatar of lies into the physical world. |

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Alchemist <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Alchemists ain't afraid to use logic and laborious experiments to claw magic from the dirt. Their knowledge of alchemical lore allows them to imbue inert objects with arcane volatility. They employ tinctures that heal or control, fling powders that explode or transform, and most impressively, animate rude substances into pseudo-living entities known as forgeborn.

**Motive:** Use alchemy to achieve their ends

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 6 due to their forgeborn companion; alchemical knowledge as level 7

**Combat:** Alchemists use long range pistols or rifles. At least one of their bullets may be alchemical. A forgeborn assistant also accompanies most alchemists, often helping with defense.

*Forgeborn assistant:* level 3; health 15; Armor 1

A given alchemist also has one or two of the following alchemical resources available in combat:

- **Empower:** The alchemist uses a tincture to regain 11 points of health and gain +3 to Armor for one minute (or gives this tincture to an ally).
- **Petrify:** The alchemist flings a powder that turns up to two targets in immediate range to stone on a failed Might defense roll. Targets remain stone for one minute, then regain their flesh.
- **Flummox:** The alchemist flings a powder causing two targets in immediate range to randomly attack their allies on a failed Intellect defense roll. Affected targets remain flummoxed for one minute or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn.
- **Blast:** The alchemist flings a flask a short range that detonates in an acidic blast on impact, dealing damage to all creatures in an immediate area on a failed Speed defense roll.

**Interaction:** Few alchemists can resist talking about their research and the wonders of magic that "natural philosophy" can unlock.

**Use:** The PCs need to revive an unresponsive forgeborn to learn what it knows, which means they need to find an alchemist.

**GM intrusion:** The alchemist's round has a chemical load that expands and hardens when exposed to air, trapping the target in the resulting crust until they can escape.

### Cursed Beasts

Cursed beasts are often hybrid animals, a fusion of two or more different beasts stitched together with dire sorcery, or a combination of beast and base material (such as snow and dead flesh). Other times they're ancient creatures time would've been better off forgetting.

Mysterious things, cursed beasts are often capable of coming and going as they please. In some times and places, they are called "cryptids" because at their core, they seem unknowable. Cursed beasts include dire coyotes, frostwalkers, hellfire steeds, and sulfur stalkers.

- **Chupacabra:** Part huge dog, part crocodile; quilled like a porcupine. Level 3, Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness, stealth and perception as level 7; health 13; Armor 2; bites for 5 points of damage; long-range quill attack puts target to sleep for one hour on a failed difficulty 5 Might defense roll (target can try to wake each round).
- **Quetzalsaur:** Giraffe-sized monstrosity with a 40-foot (12 m) wingspan. Level 6, Speed defense as level 4 due to size; health 33; Armor 2; flies a long distance each round; beak attack for 7 points of damage; vomits up two zombie helpers (corpses of past victims) once per conflict.
- **Grizzly Bull:** Bison bull magically crossed with a grizzly bear. Level 6, Speed defense as level 5 due to size, breaking through walls as level 8; health 28; Armor 1; horns attack deal 6 points of damage; if a foe within immediate range misses the bull, the grizzly bull gets an immediate extra attack.
- **Deathtumbler:** Human-sized tumbleweeds whose "thorns" are actually animal fangs. Level 3, Speed defense as level 4, disguise (as rotting carrion) as level 6; slashes with toothed branches for 3 points of damage; mundane attacks against deathtumbler deal only 1 point of damage each; attacks all targets in immediate area if it has surprise, dealing damage and, on a failed Might defense roll, 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).
- **Jackalope:** Jackrabbit with the horns of an antelope. Level 2, Speed defense as level 4, stealth and illusions as level 5; moves a long distance each round, immediate when burrowing; gores with antlers for 3 points of damage; creates illusion that can fill a short area and lasts for ten minutes or until interacted with.
- **Nightcrawler:** 20-foot (6 m) long earthworm with skin stripped from past prey. Level 4, Speed defense as level 3; bite deals 5 points of damage.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Dire Coyote <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Remnants of ancient populations reinvigorated by cursed magic, dire coyotes hunt lost and isolated creatures, regardless of whether the prey is alive or already dead. Dire coyotes are gaunt and sinewy, almost as large as a horse. Their hides are branded with arcane sigils that still glow and smoke with the sorcery that pulses through them.

Dire coyotes usually hunt in teams of two or three. However, their howls give the impression of a far larger number of individuals in the night.

**Motive:** Hungers for flesh, defense

**Environment:** Almost anywhere dark and isolated or near places ghosts haunt, individually and in teams of two or three

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Perception as level 6; attacks and defense against ghosts, wraiths, and other spirits as level 6

**Combat:** A dire coyote bites each round.

A dire coyote also has one or more of the following traits:

- **Forlorn Howl:** The dire coyote unleashes a forlorn howl that magically resonates within an adjacent short area (no more than once every few minutes). Creatures in the area take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor), causing them to run terrified in a random direction determined by the GM for several minutes, unless they succeed on an Intellect defense roll to end the effect early.
- **Ghost eater:** A dire coyote's attacks affect incorporeal ghosts, wraiths, and similar spirits. If a dire coyote destroys a ghost or wraith, that usually ends the haunting, even if the spirit normally returns. Destroying a ghost heals a dire coyote to full health, but afterward the dire coyote must sleep for a few hours to "digest" the essence.
- **Ignite Gun:** If a dire coyote is damaged by a gun attack (or bow, or similar mechanism), the gun wielder must immediately succeed on an Intellect defense roll or their gun ignites, burning anyone holding it for 4 points of damage each round for three rounds.

**Interaction:** Dire coyotes have a secret language and society, but usually present to outsiders as just particularly dangerous coyotes. However, if they wish, dire coyotes can speak with the voice and memories of any ghost they have personally destroyed.

**Use:** A sheriff who posted a bounty on dire coyotes has gone missing, and their spouse needs someone to go find them.

**GM intrusion:** The dire coyote takes on the likeness of a ghost of someone the character knew—the ghost is someone the dire coyote has recently destroyed.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Frostwalker <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
A frostwalker is a cursed beast made of packed snow layered over the severed limbs, heads, gristle, antlers, and sinew from deer, wolves, and sometimes people who've died in the cold. As such, they vary in appearance. Some are about the size of wolves, others are human-sized with antlers, and a few—especially those with more limbs and/or heads than normal—can be up to twice the size of a person.

Frostwalkers may be creations of dire sorcery, though some gain motive force from the spirits of blizzards, ice, and enmity earned through past atrocity.

**Motive:** Revenge

**Environment:** Almost anywhere cold enough for snow and ice

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Perception as level 5

**Combat:** Frostwalkers bite, gore, or claw with whatever body part they have available.

Frostwalkers may also have one or more of the following abilities:

- **Frozen:** The frostwalker regains 1 point of health for each point of damage they would otherwise take from cold. In freezing temperatures and lower, they regain 1 point of health each round (assuming they're not destroyed).
- **Scream the Blizzard:** The frostwalker can expel screaming cold winds (no more than once every few minutes), filling an adjacent short area. Creatures in the area take 4 points of ambient damage from the cold and, on a failed Might defense roll, are frozen in place for one minute or until they succeed on a Might-based roll as their action. Even a successful Might defense roll dazes the target with cold, hindering their tasks for one minute.
- **Small and Quick:** About the size of a wolf, this frostwalker only has 1 Armor but can move a long distance each round.
- **Snow Monster:** Twice the size of a person, this frostwalker might have two or more heads (one wolf, one deer) and extra arms. It attacks twice per round, moves an immediate distance each round, and has 24 health.

**Interaction:** Frostwalkers are usually made (or form spontaneously) to enact vengeance or to attack a foe, and will do so until they're destroyed.

**Use:** When the lake freezes over, monstrous things made of snow slide across the solid surface and begin terrorizing whatever they find.

Frostwalkers could be classified as necrovores instead of (or in addition to) cursed beasts, or possibly even as a forgeborn variety. Creature classification isn't as neat and tidy as some alchemists might wish.

**GM intrusion:** An important piece of the character's equipment freezes solid, rendering it unusable until it's thawed.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hellfire Steed <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Intermittently ridden straight out of Hell by demons wearing borrowed flesh, the Damned, and others seeking to escape the accursed underworld, hellfire steeds are demonic, fire-dripping destriers. Their manes are boiling napalm, their glowing red hooves leave prints that burn and smolder for days, and a single demonic horn curls from their brows. Once free of Hell, these steeds typically buck their riders and race off across the prairielands, setting blazes as they go, apparently seeking to wreak as much havoc as they can before they're reclaimed by Hell.

**Motive:** Havoc and suffering

**Environment:** Almost anywhere; sometimes ridden as a mount by the powerful or foolish

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Armor:** 1 (10 against fire)

**Combat:** Hellfire steeds attack twice each round with their horn.

Hellfire steeds also have one or more of the following traits:

- **Fires of the Underworld:** Anyone not chosen as a rider by the hellfire steed that ends a turn within immediate range of the creature takes 2 points of damage from hellish heat.
- **Lifedraining Horn:** The hellfire steed deals an additional 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) with its horn attack once every few minutes, gaining that drained life as health.
- **Render Immune to Fire:** If the hellfire steed is compelled or agrees to serve as a mount, the steed's rider takes no damage from the steed's Fires of the Underworld and gains +2 Armor against fire from other sources while riding.
- **From Hell:** Once per year, a hellfire steed can emerge from or enter Hell through a transitory portal, bearing riders if it chooses.
  - **Death Gallop:** If killed, a hellfire steed's body animates one last time, galloping a long distance before turning to ash. Everyone along its final route takes 5 points of fire damage on a failed Speed defense roll.

**Interaction:** Though usually driven by demonic desire, hellfire steeds are fully sapient and can speak all languages. They may negotiate with someone seeking to use them as a mount, but only in return for a promise of committing atrocities.

**Use:** Stuck in Hell or a similarly hellish place, characters may have to ask a hellfire steed for a ride out.

**Loot:** A hellfire steed's horn is a sought-after alchemist ingredient; a full horn is a very expensive item.

**GM intrusion:** The steed decides it no longer wants the character as a rider and takes back their immunity to fire.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Sulfur Stalker <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Dwelling in steaming, acidic hot springs, sulfur stalkers' umbral, scaled bodies can reach lengths of 10 or more feet (3 m). Their broad, flat heads feature wide, gaping mouths filled with rows of sharp teeth. Feathery tendrils fringe their heads, twining and stretching as if of their own accord. Powerful clawed limbs and an eel-like tail mean they're equally adept on land and in liquid—even boiling hot, acrid springs. The overpowering smell of sulfur—like rotten eggs—precedes and follows them.

Sulfur stalkers periodically emerge from their pools and migrate long distances, presumably to mate. During this migration, they grow ravenously hungry, preying on anything. They also drag away people, which they feed to their newly hatched young.

**Motive:** Defense, gather food for newly hatched young

**Environment:** Anywhere near hot springs, or anywhere during seasons of migration

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Armor:** 2 (5 against fire; immune to acid)

**Movement:** Short; swims a short distance each round

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to size; stealth as level 6

**Combat:** Sulfur stalkers bite.

Additional sulfur stalker abilities include one or more of the following:

- **Tendril Aura:** Any creature that begins their turn within immediate range of a sulfur stalker must succeed on a Speed defense roll or be grazed by a feathery tendril for 3 points of damage from dripping acid.
- **Acid Geyser:** A boiling-hot acid stream sprays all creatures in a short-range line, dealing 9 points of damage on a failed Speed defense roll, and 2 points of damage even if successful. (The sulfur stalker can't make this attack more than once every few minutes.)
- **Regrow:** If damaged, a sulfur stalker regains 2 health each round on any round it hasn't taken damage from cold or magic. This ability is so pernicious that an entirely new sulfur stalker could grow from a severed portion.

**Interaction:** Sulfur stalkers have a language, and some can speak human tongues, especially those that have made deals with locals. Such deals usually involve turning over some number of other people each year for the stalker to eat—culled from a local jail, taken in outlaw raids, etc.

**Use:** A bounty for sulfur stalker eggs is so generous that folks everywhere begin hunting. This riles up the local stalker population, who begin attacking towns and homesteads preemptively.

**Loot:** Because sulfur stalkers tend to capture people to feed their young, cast-off belongings can sometimes be found in their nests—which are well-hidden locations near hot springs, but not under them. In addition, a nest might contain an egg or two, each equal in value to an expensive item.

**GM intrusion:** A severed segment of a sulfur stalker animates as a half-size, level 3 sulfur stalker that attacks the character. The stalker might have to bite off its tail to start this process.

### Forgeborn

Forgeborn—also called golems—are animate figures of metal, reanimated flesh, or other normally inert materials. They are constructed for a specific purpose; an angalith is usually sent to punish or guard, and inkubuses are commonly seeded as spies or assassins.

Most forgeborn have the following traits:

- **Dim:** Most forgeborn (though there are many exceptions) aren't quick thinkers; their Intellect defense against being tricked or mentally attacked is level 2.
- **Temperamental:** A forgeborn can break free of the spells that bind them to service for brief periods. This happens automatically two rounds after the forgeborn fails an Intellect defense roll against an attack or attempt to control them. The triggered forgeborn attacks twice each round for two or three rounds, choosing targets indiscriminately but preferring anyone who attempted to control them.
- **Resistant:** Forgeborn cannot be stunned or dazed. They are immune to most poisons and disease.
- **Quiet:** Most forgeborn can't speak (but some can).

- **Locomotem:** 20-foot (6 m) tall humanoid figure fabricated from a coal-fed train engine. Level 6, Speed defense as level 4 due to size; health 30; Armor 5; steam whistle (once per hour) stuns creatures in immediate range on failed Might defense roll.
- **Fleshmare:** Made from the stitched-together flesh of deceased horses. Level 4; health 24; Armor 3; hoof attack deals 6 points of damage; electrical damage heals instead of harms fleshmare.
- **Alchehemoth:** 10-foot (3 m) tall humanoid figure fabricated from a metallic whiskey still. Level 5, Speed defense as level 4 due to size; health 27; fists deal 7 points of damage; inebriating breath causes creatures in immediate range to fall into booze-fueled slumber for one hour on failed Might defense roll.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Angalith <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
An angalith—a forgeborn fabricated from prismatic stained glass windows taken from cathedrals and churches—is a 15-foot (4.5 m) tall figure.

**Motive:** Follow the will of their creator (but actually, break the control of their creator or whoever has control over them; see Temperamental)

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 27

**Damage Inflicted:** 7 points

**Armor:** 3

**Movement:** Short; long when flying

**Modifications:** Intellect defense as level 2; Speed defense as level 4 due to size

**Combat:** Angaliths slice foes with jagged edges of their stained glass wings.

Angaliths have the following additional abilities and traits:

- **Prismatic Blaze:** Six prismatic shafts of light shine from the angalith's core as their action, illuminating the sins of all creatures within short range (no more than once each minute). A given target is subject to only one shaft of light, which they must make an Intellect defense roll to resist. Choose or roll for which sin is brought to light for each target.
  1. Red (Wrath): Target attacks an ally on their next turn.
  2. Orange (Envy): Target throws mud/dung/etc. in the face of an ally on their next turn.
  3. Yellow (Apathy): Target sits down and stares into space on their next turn.
  4. Green (Greed): Target attempts to steal something from an ally on their next turn.
  5. Blue (Gluttony): Target chows down nearest food—or goes looking for some—on their next turn.
  6. Indigo (Pride): Target sniffs disdainfully and walks away from the combat on their next turn.
- **Forgeborn Traits:** Angaliths are Dim, Temperamental, Resistant, and Quiet.

**Interaction:** Angaliths resonate with the worship and faith their component parts once witnessed. Often, that faith was preaching about the welfare of other beings, so they may stop to help those in need. But if they see someone act against the common good, in an angalith's estimation, that someone is due only hellfire.

**Use:** Angaliths—like most forgeborn—are tough encounters even for those who are tooled up for a fight. However, they can be assuaged with promises of saintly acts or demonstrations of good works, which could turn an angry angalith found in a demolished church into a temporary ally.

**GM intrusion:** The character sliced by the jagged edge of a stained glass wing begins bleeding for 1 ambient damage each round until someone succeeds on a difficulty 3 healing task to stop the flow.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Inkubus <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
An inkubus enjoys two different states of being. One is as an alchemically marked-up page, whether that's a sheet in a book or newspaper, a letter, a broadsheet, or a wanted poster. There's little to distinguish this inkubus "seed" from regular paper without a concerted search for magical influence. Each seed has a trigger, set by the alchemist who created it. The trigger could be when the page is read, when a certain amount of time is expired, when a specified individual sees the page, or something else.

A triggered inkubus takes on substance either immediately, as nearby paper swirls in and accretes around the seed, or gradually, if the inkubus is meant to remain unobtrusive (as often happens when the seed is a wanted poster whose target just wandered by).

When fully embodied, an inkubus appears as a human-sized dragonfly-like paper sculpture covered in constantly scrolling words.

**Motive:** As determined when seeded (but actually, break the control of their creator or whoever has control over them; see Temperamental)

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short; long when flying

**Modifications:** Stealth as level 8 (when not fully manifest)

**Combat:** Inkubuses slice targets with knife-sharp paper cuts as their attack.

Inkubuses may have one or more of the following additional traits, depending on their purpose:

- **Word of Power:** An inkubus contains a "word of power" that it can display as an action once per day. A target in short range who sees it and fails an Intellect defense roll is affected as indicated for one minute (or longer for Forget):
  - *Stunned:* Target takes no action.
  - *Confess:* Target starts with their most egregious crimes/secrets, one per turn.
  - *Betray:* Target attacks nearby allies.
  - *Forget:* Target goes back to whatever they were doing and doesn't remember meeting the inkubus unless or until they meet again.
- **Words on the Floor:** The inkubus can send written words to their creator (or anyone), such as a warning, an update on their status, or some other predetermined signal. Words appear on a surface near the creator.
- **Forgeborn Traits:** Inkubuses are Resistant and Temperamental.

**Interaction:** The inkubus is more self-aware than most other forgeborn, and may interact with characters by using its Words on the Floor ability.

**Use:** The PCs receive a letter from a famous alchemist, which becomes an inkubus that relays the alchemist's message (an invitation, a warning, a threat, or something else).

**GM intrusion:** Important documents or other papers the character carries flap away and become part of the inkubus.

### Gunfighters

Gunfighters live and die by their six-chambered peacemakers using a threatened—or actual—lightning-quick draw to accomplish their aims. Most gunfighters are regular folks who practice their craft so diligently that they become the best, at least until they measure themselves against a desperado who's a smidge faster. Most gunfighters in a weird west setting have a bit of the supernatural about them, but one variety of gunfighter, known as a hex gunner, explicitly mixes magic with bullets.

- **Bounty hunter:** Figure in sleek, form-fitting dark duster and wide-brimmed hat with twin guns. Level 4; tracking, surveillance, stealth, and disguise as level 6; health 15; Armor 1; attacks twice with long-range pistol; a melee attack with locking cuffs (level 5) binds target to a nearby large object on a failed Speed defense roll.
- **Deadshot:** Eight-foot (3 m) figure stitched together from the reanimated flesh of deceased gunslingers. Level 5; initiative as level 8; health 27; Armor 4; long-range pistol attack deals 7 points of damage; once a minute fires necrotic bullet that deals 3 points of damage each round (ignores Armor) until bullet extracted with a difficulty 4 healing task.
- **Gunslinger:** Grim-faced pistoleer pursuing vengeance, doing crime, or making a name for themself. Level 4, initiative as level 7; health 18; Armor 1; long-range pistol attack deals 6 points of damage (or 8 points with eased attack if they attack before their foe); every hit increases damage by 1 point for the rest of the encounter (to a maximum of +10).
- **Lawman:** Driven by a dream of justice, a lawman enforces rules even when no one else will. Level 5, Might defense as level 6; health 20; Armor 1; long-range rifle attacks; the first time a lawman would normally succumb to their wounds (having lost all their health), they instead gain a second wind (and 10 health); banishing rounds deal full damage to ghosts and similarly protected creatures.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hex Gunner <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Hex gunners weave iron and lead with Hellish sorcery. Gifts from a demon gained during a crossroads deal, a hex gunner's six-shooters are demonic constructs that grant the equivalent of years of practice and occult study. Their bullets whisper in the chamber, smoking with necromancy, then scream with exultant, hellish fury when fired. Each round is imbued with fragments of souls from those the hex gunner has previously defeated in gunfights.

Hex gunners may be pledged to a literal lord of Hell (or some other occult being of damnation and pain). Only if they harvest a certain number of souls during their gunfighting career is their own soul safe from being claimed when their life ends.

**Motive:** Reap souls for Hell

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Initiative as level 8

**Combat:** Hex gunners attack twice each round with their cursed, long-range six-shooters.

Hex gunners may also have one or more of the following traits:

- **Hexed Shot:** Once every few minutes, the hex gunner can fire a hexed shot that not only deals normal damage, but also inflicts an additional 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) on a failed Intellect defense roll.
- **Soulfire:** Immediately after killing a creature with a soul, the hex gunner can choose to regain 10 points of health. If they do, that soul is devoured by the guns.
- **Death Gallop:** If the hex gunner rides a mount, the mount rides at double speed and can ride over difficult terrain with little hindrance.

**Interaction:** Hex gunners are people who've made a deal with the Devil, probably because of something they wanted very, very badly. They might be willing to give information, even help, as long as it doesn't further impair their own situations.

**Use:** Hired to bring in a bounty, a hex gunner finds the PCs along the way to its prey.

**GM intrusion:** The hex gunner fires a shot that detonates in a spray of hellfire, dealing damage to all creatures in immediate range.

### Necrovore

Necrovores—otherwise known as undead—are what some call those that feed on death, those that are dead but still move, those that feed on life, and all things that lie somewhere in between. Now, some might quibble about using "necrovore" for such a wide range of creatures. But does it make a lick of difference if you call a shade of the tomb—a wraith that takes form from a gravestone's shadow—a necrovore, a demon, or an undead when it's draining all joy from existence? Nope. Same holds true for a deathbinder, hollowed ranger, risen (also called Damned), and tombdrift.

- **Ghost Rider:** Harbingers of chaos and catastrophe, ghost riders spread havoc long past their deaths. Level 6; health 20; Armor 1; rides a skeletal mount a long distance each round; long-range pistol attack deals 6 damage; short-range curse causes target who fails an Intellect defense roll to lose their next turn as they freeze in terror.
- **Wraith Lord:** A malign artifact or especially powerful curse may form an exceptional wraith. Level 5, stealth as level 6; health 22; Armor 1; flies a short distance each round (or is mounted on a quetzalsaur); spectral weapon deals 6 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and induces target to fall one step on the damage track each day a Might defense roll fails (three successes purge the effect); if destroyed, a wraith usually reforms the following midnight.
- **Zombie sorcerer:** Magic-infused corpse that knows enough sorcery to be dangerous. Level 4; health 18; moves an immediate distance each round; long-range necrotic blast deals 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) to all in an immediate area, or 1 point even with a successful defense roll; even-numbered attack rolls that would reduce its health to 0 reduce health to 1 instead.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Deathbinder <---> 7 (21) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Alchemists who learn enough science and magic to retain corporeal existence after death, like risen, might transition to necrovore status. Unlike a risen, a deathbinder ensures their eternal existence by placing splinters of their soul into six bullets chambered in a "soul pistol." If all six bullets are fired, the deathbinder is finally destroyed.

Two pistols are holstered on a deathbinder's gun belt: the deathbinder's soul pistol, which they reserve for special circumstances, and their "workaday" six-shooter, loaded with unique alchemical rounds.

A deathbinder usually resides alone, herding cursed beasts or forgeborn creatures of their own creation, probably astride a fleshmare.

**Motive:** Continue alchemical studies and magical collection without interruption

**Environment:** Wilderness, ghost towns, and other underpopulated areas

**Health:** 27

**Damage Inflicted:** 7 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short

**Combat:** A deathbinder attacks twice each round with long-range pistol attacks.

The deathbinder also has most or all of the following attacks and traits:

- **Alchemical Pistol:** Targets hit by a "workaday" pistol shot take damage and, on a failed Might or Intellect defense roll, suffer one additional effect:
  - Target is frozen in amber until they can escape.
  - Deathbinder learns one of the target's secrets.
  - Target is teleported to a pre-prepared nearby location.
- **Soul Pistol:** Under extreme circumstances, a deathbinder may fire a precious bullet from their soul pistol, hoping they'll have a chance later to rebind the liberated soul energy. A bullet from the soul gun has all of the following deadly traits:
  - Automatically hits target within long range—a targeted PC should get a GM intrusion for this attack.
  - The soul round deals damage and the character descends two steps on the damage track, or one step on a successful Might defense roll.
  - Target is cursed on a failed Intellect defense roll.
- **Alchemical Resurrection:** If destroyed, a deathbinder usually reforms within 1d6 days unless all six bullets from their soul pistol are fired.

**Interaction:** Deathbinders don't cotton to interruptions because the reason they chose undeath in the first place was to pursue a specialized purpose—usually, even deeper secrets of alchemy and/or collecting more unique magical artifacts and treasures.

**Use:** A herd of ghost cattle wanders into town and causes problems. Folks say it's the fault of the "lich cowboy" who lives out in the wastes.

**Loot:** The deathbinder's pistols have uniquely powerful rounds loaded in them; roll once on the Alchemical Rounds and Slugs table.

**GM intrusion:** The deathbinder makes an extra pistol attack even if it's not their turn.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hollowed Ranger <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Cloaked in a tattered duster and riding nothing but a memory, the necrovore known as a hollowed ranger is a traveling portal to elsewhere—perhaps connecting to a nightmare, the far future after everyone has died, or some region of Hell where corpses shamble beneath an eternal eclipse.

Hollowed rangers ride forth where good people were gunned down in cold blood and then dumped in shallow, unmarked graves. The injustice rips a hole in the world, which the murdered spirit possesses and becomes. Unfortunately, a hollowed ranger's desire for vengeance doesn't restrict them from visiting horror on most everything they encounter.

**Motive:** Vengeance (first against their killer, then their killer's family and friends, then their killer's species, and so on)

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 6 due to partially non-existent body

**Combat:** A hollowed ranger's long-range entropic bullet—fired from a rifle-shaped hole in reality—deals 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) as a bit of the target's reality is blasted away.

A hollowed ranger also has the following traits:

- **Necrovore Door:** As their action, the ranger shudders as a wraith lord emerges from their body, acting as the ranger wishes for one minute. After one minute, the wraith is drawn back into the ranger, or it just fades. (Other necrovores could instead be called from the deathly realms a hollowed ranger is connected to, but anything level 3 or higher takes two actions to disgorge.)
- **Fall Into Oblivion:** On a failed Might defense roll, a living creature starting their turn in immediate range of a hollowed ranger is sucked through the hollowed ranger's form into the deathly realm beyond. This realm is anathema to life—the affected target immediately takes 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) from the necrotic energy draining their soul. Affected targets are drained of life each additional round they spend in the deathly realm, but can attempt a Might-based task to pull themselves back to their reality. The hollowed ranger regains 1 point of health each time an affected target's soul is so drained.
- **Door Shift:** A hollowed ranger can instantly transport themself miles away as its action, if they have previously been to or seen the other location.

**Interaction:** Speaking with a voice like wind on gravestones, a hollowed ranger may tell of the primary target of their vengeance, deliver a message from a more powerful necrovore, or simply promise to eat the soul of whoever tries negotiating with them.

**Use:** Characters need to travel a huge distance and are told the quickest way is to use the door shift offered by a hollowed ranger, though doing so will require appeasing the ranger in some way.

**GM intrusion:** The character drawn through the hollowed ranger's form to a deathly realm is attacked by a ghost lurking there.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Risen <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Clawed back into "life" thanks to a promise, an alchemical experiment, or a demonic curse straight out of Hell, risen look normal enough—from a distance. Up close, something ain't right. That's all the more obvious if the risen is someone folks knew before they died.

Risen—also known as the Damned—spook horses and set dogs to growling. They have unblinking eyes like coins and skin the color of a snake's belly, and are naturally as motionless as a corpse when not engaged in an activity. A risen may just want to be left alone, or they could seek to right a wrong, serve as a deathbinder's herald, or ride in an undead posse looking to take as much as they can from a world they know would just as soon put them back in their grave.

**Motive:** Varies

**Environment:** Out-of-the-way places

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Combat:** A risen makes a long-range pistol attack.

Risen also have one or more of the following additional traits:

- **Damned Rounds:** Every other attack against PCs is Hell-tainted, blazing with hellfire. If one of these bullets strikes true, the target combusts for an additional 3 points of damage (ignores Armor) each round until an action is taken to smother the flames.
- **Necrovore Resilience:** The first time in an encounter that a risen would normally succumb to their wounds (having lost all their health), they instead remain active and regain 1 health.
- In addition, risen don't breathe—drowning, suffocation, and similar threats don't faze them.
- **Sometimes They Come Back:** A destroyed risen might reanimate within a few days, unless its head is removed from its body and separated by a couple of miles, or the body is burned to ash.

**Interaction:** Risen are rarely excitable; even those bent on mayhem are chillingly quiet as they murder and burn. Some risen are open to negotiation and alliances, while others would as soon shoot as talk.

**Use:** Folks are concerned because someone who looks a lot like Luke Reynolds has taken up farming at the old Reynolds place, even though outlaws killed the whole family.

**GM intrusion:** The character recognizes the risen as someone they personally killed and is dazed with surprise until the end of their next turn, hindering all tasks.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Tombdrift <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Necrovore sand dunes 30 feet (9 m) in diameter are sometimes seeded from those who die in the desert and are buried only by shifting sands. When inactive, it's nearly impossible to distinguish tombdrifts from regular desert dunes. But when one senses life, the necrovore rolls forward like a slow ocean wave, or alternatively, condenses into the shape of the spirit that seeded the undead thing. When assuming the echo of the person who seeded them, tombdrifts might speak. However, keeping such a shape requires energy—the assumed shape is constantly crumbling away and reforming, until it collapses once again into an unquiet, hungry dune.

**Motive:** Bury the living; feed on life

**Environment:** Desert and badlands

**Health:** 23

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Immediate (but see Dust Devil Speed)

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 2 due to size

**Combat:** The tombdrift abrades every creature in immediate range with scouring sand. The tombdrift is immune to poison, disease, and life-draining effects.

They also have one or more of the following attacks and traits:

- **Drain Life:** One target damaged by the tombdrift is subject to life drain, taking 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) on a failed Might defense roll. In addition, the target is sickened until the end of their next turn, hindering all tasks. On a successful defense roll, the target still takes 1 point of Speed damage, but isn't sickened.
- **Dust Devil Speed:** The tombdrift spins up into a dust devil of sand that speeds forward a long distance (no more than once every minute), attacking all creatures along the line of travel. On a failed Might defense roll, damaged targets are also blinded on their next turn.
- **Sand Regeneration:** Tombdrifts regain 1 health each round they are in a desert or badlands region, unless they've taken damage from banishing rounds or similar anti-undead attacks (in which case they don't begin regaining health again for a couple of minutes).

**Interaction:** When they take the echo of their former shape, tombdrifts can communicate in rasping voices, and may choose to negotiate with other creatures instead of draining their life. Tombdrifts may want their remains properly buried, or something else. Some tombdrifts don't care or don't remember their lives and simply wish to feed.

**Use:** A sandstorm blew through the town's cemetery with enough force to rip graves out of the ground. Now, some drifts of sand left in the storm's wake have started moving.

**Loot:** A tombdrift, which contains the remains of the individual who seeded it (maybe just a few eroded bones), might also have some of their belongings, such as a box with a few remaining alchemical rounds.

**GM intrusion:** The character is pulled into the dune and is crushed and suffocated for 5 points of ambient damage each round until they can escape with a Might-based roll as their action.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Shade of the Tomb <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}}{{< /hint >}}
Though thankfully rare, shades of the tomb (commonly called "tomb shades") may spontaneously manifest beneath the dull light of the Tomb Moon, taking form from gravestone shadows. Other times tomb shades are called into brief existence by a summoning spell. When they resolve, they regard the world with the head of an ink-beaked raven, with half a dozen clutching ebony arms emerging from their tenebrous cloak. If need be, a tomb shade can seep through cracks and around barriers that would stymie most corporeal beings.

**Motive:** Douse other beings' light, life, and joy

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 20

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short; short when climbing

**Modifications:** Stealth as level 7

**Combat:** A tomb shade's touch drains life, inflicting Speed damage (ignores Armor).

In dim light and darkness, a tomb shade only takes 1 point of damage from successful attacks against them.

Individual tomb shades may also have one or more of the following abilities they can use as their action:

- **Siphon:** On a failed Might defense task, a short-range necrotic ray deals 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), which the shade gains as health, up to their maximum.
- **Darken:** The shade summons magical darkness that blooms from a point within long range (no more than once every ten minutes). The darkness fills an area an immediate distance across and lasts for ten minutes. Even creatures that can normally see in darkness can't see in this magical murk, except for tomb shades and undead.
- **Anguish:** The shade drains happiness and joy from all creatures within immediate range (no more than once per minute). Targets that fail an Intellect defense roll take 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and are disconsolate, losing their next turn. Each turn after that they can attempt another Intellect defense roll to regain their composure and act normally.
- **Portal:** The tomb shade dissolves, their animus departing (possibly back to the Tomb Moon). The resulting implosive burst of necrotic energy deals 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) to all creatures within immediate range that fail a Speed defense task. Damaged targets must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled partially through the portal, sustaining 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round from the necrotic contact until they can pull free with a successful Might roll as their action. When the last target pulls free (or dies and is pulled through), the portal closes.

**Interaction:** Sinister and conniving, a tomb shade doesn't speak, but uses its many arms for magical signing, usually only to make threats.

**Use:** An alchemist wants PCs to collect a cursed book for their library, but whenever someone opens the tome, shadows (a tomb shade) swallow the reader.

## Cyphers And Artifacts Of The Weird West

### Subtle Cyphers

Subtle cyphers are appropriate as an adjunct to weird west games that have at least a passing similarity to historical reality.

That said, weird west games—with their connection to magic and/or sci-fi technology—have a lot of room to include thematically appropriate manifest cyphers (as shown by the examples provided later in this chapter). If you include manifest cyphers, remember that the Cypher System rules assume players have regular opportunities to regain cyphers after using the ones they have. Out in the badlands, deserts, or prairielands where weird west adventurers often find themselves, manifest cyphers might be harder to obtain. Letting subtle cyphers fill in the gaps during periods when PCs don't find any manifest ones is a good idea.

### Manifest Cyphers

Manifest cyphers in a weird west game could be the product of some oddity of your particular setting, such as alien invaders. However, the primary assumption is that manifest weird west cyphers are created by alchemists, sorcerers, demons, and the like.

#### Alien Manifest Cyphers

In a weird west setting enduring an ongoing alien invasion, encroaching alien outposts, crashed starfighters, and the rare alien conscientious objector who feels bad about conquering the place could all be sources of uncanny items. Given their off-world manufacture, these manifest cyphers are probably nearly inscrutable, but PCs are able to get a single use out of them, even if it's not the use the aliens had in mind.

#### Alchemical Manifest Cyphers

Alchemy is usually attributed to alchemists, while sorcery is attributed to demons and/or those who learned their magic from a Hellish source. But sometimes alchemists create items of such dire consequence that demons would be happy to take the credit.

The most prominent alchemical manifest cyphers are alchemical rounds and slugs—ammunition for pistols, rifles, and shotguns.

A handful of alchemists sell their rounds and slugs to interested buyers for an expensive cost, or very expensive for level 5 and higher alchemical rounds and slugs.

Alchemical rounds operate using a few special rules, as follow:

- **Form of Alchemical Rounds:** Alchemical rounds—such as a banishing round or an asphyxiation round—are alchemical manifest cyphers in the form of bullets or shells that visibly glow in dim light. The alchemist who made a given bullet or shell usually inscribes it with their mark—a symbol, their initials, and so on.
- **Loading Alchemical Rounds:** Alchemical rounds use whatever reloading rules are in use in the setting. So, if the reloading rules are such that reloading—when a gunfighter pulls the bullet from a bandolier or cartridge belt and slips it into the chamber—is part of another action, a gunfighter with an alchemical round available may simply declare any given shot they attempt is using that round. Otherwise, it takes an action to load an alchemical round into the chamber. However, the continuing effect an alchemical round confers lessens the sting of the action spent reloading.
- **Continuing Effect of Alchemical Round Attacks:** When an alchemical round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made with that gun gain the same benefit for the next minute (as indicated in each alchemical round entry). For example, if a character fires a banishing round, every attack they make with the same gun for the next minute is also considered a banishing round, regardless of whether the first attack hits or misses. Some alchemical bullets do not infuse the gun they're fired from, as indicated by name—they're referred to as slugs instead of rounds—and in the description. For example, dark slugs and thunder slugs do not infuse the gun, but instead create a lasting effect in an adjacent area. If a second alchemical round is fired from the same gun while an earlier infusion effect remains active, refer to the Alchemical Round Fusion Effect table.

- **Answering Slug:** Level 1d6. Form: "RETORT" scribed on bullet case. Effect: A successful attack with an answering slug damages a target normally. In addition, for the next minute, any time another creature attacks the shooter with a ranged attack, the shooter can make an immediate extra attack against that creature using the same gun, ignoring reloading restrictions (if any apply). While the effect lasts, the shooter can make a number of additional immediate "answering" attacks equal to the cypher's level (in addition to making their normal attack for the round).
- **Asphyxiation Round:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Blowing wind image scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. A successful attack damages a target normally. If the damaged target is a living creature that needs to breathe, the target becomes short of breath, hindering all their tasks for a number of rounds equal to the cypher's level. If the same target is struck and damaged again within that minute with another asphyxiation round, they are stunned as air is alchemically forced from their lungs and blood. Unless at least one asphyxiation round stuck in their flesh is removed from a stunned target's flesh with a successful level 4 healing task, the stunned target asphyxiates and dies at the end of the minute the target first became short of breath.
- **Banishing Round:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: "EXCLUDE LIFE" scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. Undead, ghosts, cursed beasts, and other supernatural targets take full damage from this attack (if successful). Affected targets gain no benefit from Armor, intangibility, or other protection, and lose any automatic healing ability for a number of minutes equal to this cypher's level. Normal targets with protective alchemical spells similarly lose that protection. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, successful attacks deal +1 point of damage.
- **Dark Slug:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Round is dark as the night sky. Effect: Firing the slug creates a region of absolute darkness from which no sound emerges. The region fills an adjacent short area (or long area if the cypher is level 5 or higher) and lasts for about a minute. Any creature whose level is less than the cypher's that enters (or begins their turn in) the area can see nothing (even if they can normally see in darkness), and any light source of lower level than the cypher's that is brought into or begins a turn in the darkness is deactivated. While the cypher is in effect, successfully escaping the darkness is hindered by four steps.
- **Entombing Round:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Coffin image scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. A successful attack with an entombing round doesn't damage the target; instead, a target up to human size is held in place, still able to take actions but unable to move or leave the spot for one minute or until they escape with a successful Might-based roll. (NPCs whose level is higher than the round's break free if they spend their next turn escaping.) If the same target is hit again with an entombing round while still held immobile, they are enveloped in an expanding mass that takes the shape of a closed, secured wooden casket whose level is equal to the round's level. A third successful attack against an affected target causes the casket to sink 6 feet (2 m) into the earth, buried beneath a pile of loose soil. A trapped target is held within the casket until the gunfighter releases them, the casket is destroyed, the target breaks free, or midnight arrives, at which time the casket dissolves to dust. If the target's casket is buried when their casket dissolves, they have until their breath expires (a minute or so) to dig their way to the surface (a level 5 task) or remain buried. Wooden casket: level equal to entombing round cypher; dissolves at midnight.
- **Exorcism Round:** Level 1d6 + 4. Form: Broken horn image scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. A successful attack with an exorcism round damages a target normally. In addition, ghosts and demons (whether immaterial or wearing someone else's flesh)—as well as other creatures strongly tied to an alternate realm—hit by this attack are exorcised if their level is less than or equal to the cypher's level. An exorcised creature disappears and is unable to remanifest physically in the same area or realm for at least one day. This attack is potentially as effective against a target being possessed by a ghost or demon, ending the possession, though the host is also damaged by the bullet.
- **Exsanguinating Round:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Red blood smears bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. The target takes damage normally. If the target is living and has blood, it begins bleeding for 1 point of damage per round for one minute. Additional successful attacks increase the damage on a one-per-one-basis, and extend the period of effect. The expelled blood forms a mystical rivulet that connects the shooter with the bleeding target. If the target dies, the shooter gains an immediate free recovery roll (or regains 10 health if an NPC). If the shooter who fired the round is a vampire and their bleeding target is killed, the vampire is completely healed and gains the benefit of having just drank a victim's blood to their fill.
- **Flaying Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Bullet case seems made of skin. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. A successful attack damages a target normally. The target's skin/fur/outer layer begins to peel away as if they'd gained the attention of an invisible flensing blade, hindering their tasks for one minute per cypher level. The second time a target is struck and damaged with a flaying round within a minute of first being struck, larger sections of skin peel away, hindering them by two steps. Each three steps of hindrance gained also moves the target one step down the damage track.
- **Ghost Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Round appears ghostly, translucent, not quite real. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. Unliving targets (undead, forgeborn, elementals, objects, etc.) take damage normally from a ghost round attack, or normal damage +2 if the cypher is level 5 or higher. However, the ghost round ignores living flesh, passing through it like . . . a ghost.
- **Glacier Slug:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Bullet case seems made of ice. Effect: A successful attack deals damage equal to the cypher's level and freezes the target (rendering them helpless) for a number of minutes equal to the cypher's level. A PC who succeeds on a Might-based roll as their action can thaw early (an affected NPC whose level is higher than the cypher's can use their next turn to break free). On a miss, the target still takes 2 points of damage from the cold (3 points if the cypher is level 5 or higher).
- **Gunlantern Slug:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Bullet case glows dim as a candle. Effect: Firing the slug (either as an attack or into the air) causes the gun to emit a beam of light for three hours per cypher level. The beam brightly illuminates an immediate area the gun wielder points their gun at within long range. If the wielder points their light into a region of magical darkness, and the effect that created the darkness is of lower level than the gunlantern slug, the darkness is dispelled. If the magical darkness is higher level, the duration of the illumination effect ends.
- **Haunted Slug:** Level 1d6. Form: Slug emits ghostly whispers. Effect: Whether the attack against the primary target hits (and deals damage normally) or misses, the bullet's malignance isn't spent—it attacks up to 3 additional targets within short range of the primary target. (The PC rolls an attack against each one.) Each additional attack successively increases the GM intrusion range by 1. If a GM intrusion is triggered, the haunted bullet hits something other than what the attacker intended, such as an ally.
- **Heavenly Fire Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Bullet emits a silvery glow. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. An attack with the round deals 1 additional point of damage on a successful attack (or 2 more if the cypher is level 5 or higher). If the same target is hit a total of three times by a heavenly fire round in the same minute, they are transformed into a pillar of salt, meaning they are effectively dead until alchemy or curse-breaking magic is applied.
- **Hellfire Slug:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Bullet casing seems to burn with red flame. Effect: A successful attack deals damage normally. In addition to potential damage from the initial attack, the bullet explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting fire damage equal to the cypher's level (roll an attack against each creature in the area separately, including the initial target, who may or may not have already taken damage).
- **Hexing Round:** Level 1d6 + 4. Form: "HEX" scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. A successful attack with a hexing round doesn't damage the target; instead, a target whose level is equal to or less than the round's level is hindered on all tasks. Additional successful attacks against the same target hinder their tasks by additional steps. If a target is struck by a number of hexing rounds equal to half or more of their level, they enter a "hexed" state for a number of days equal to the round's level. A hexed target resembles someone sleepwalking who takes whatever suggestion is given them, even if that proves harmful. A hexed PC can attempt to break the enchantment once each day at dawn, and each time they're damaged, by succeeding on an Intellect defense roll. NPCs whose level is higher than the cypher's can break free a couple of days after they're hexed, or sooner if they take damage.
- **Impervious Slug:** Level 1d6. Form: "INVULNERABLE" scribed on bullet case. Effect: Someone successfully attacked with the bullet gains a number of points of Armor equal to the cypher's level for one minute. The Armor is effective against all forms of damage, including those that normally ignore Armor.
- **Inebriating Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Amber liquid visible through bullet case; leaves an amber, whiskey-smelling streak in the air when fired. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. Instead of taking damage, a successfully attacked target immediately moves one step down on the intoxication track. Additional successful attacks continue moving the target on the track. Unlike most other alchemical rounds, an inebriating round can simply be swallowed by someone to gain the effect (however, doing so doesn't infuse the inebriating effect for one minute as it would to a gun it was fired from).
- **Interrogation Round:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: "ASK" scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. The target takes damage normally. If the target has a mind and can speak a language known to the gunfighter and the target's level is equal to or less than this cypher's, the target is compelled to truthfully answer one short question immediately put to them by the gunfighter. Additional successful attacks allow for truthfully answered follow-up questions. (If the attack with an interrogation round kills or incapacitates them, the target uses their dying breath to answer.)
- **Necrotic Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Bullet case seems like rotting bone. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. The necrotic round contains a core of undead flesh; it and subsequent bullets fired from the gun for the next minute mean that targets react according to their status. Against Undead: Undead targeted by a necrotic round regain health equal to 5 plus the cypher's level with each hit—undead cognizant enough to know what's happening usually don't evade these "attacks." Against the Living: The living target takes damage normally, and the necrotic flesh begins to spread through the living target's flesh; if a target whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's is successfully attacked twice with a necrotic round within a minute, the unlife overwhelms their living flesh in a horrific wave, turning them into a zombie. The zombie acts according to its nature, but it ignores the gunfighter that created it unless provoked by them.
- **Otherwhere Slug:** Level 1d6. Form: "OTHERWHERE" scribed on bullet case. Effect: Firing the slug creates an invisible doorway within immediate range that only the shooter can see and use (plus any targets they designate). The doorway leads to a chilly, lightless cavern about 20 feet (6 m) in diameter. While the cold air is breathable, it is a bit thin, and the stone making up the periphery is charcoal-like in color. The doorway to otherwhere lasts for a number of days equal to the cypher's level. When the door closes, visitors are automatically expelled back to their initial location.
- **Possessing Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Bullet burns with a reddish, heatless flame. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. An attack with the round deals 1 additional point of damage on a successful attack (or 2 points if the cypher is level 5 or higher). If the same target is hit a total of three times by a possessing round in the same minute, they become possessed by a demon. The newly demon-possessed target ignores the shooter unless provoked.
- **Sobering Round:** Level 1d6. Form: Bullet smells like strong, bitter coffee; leaves a cloudy, coffee-smelling streak in the air when fired. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. Instead of taking damage, a successfully attacked target immediately becomes sober, no matter their position on the intoxication track. Unlike most other alchemical rounds, a sobering round can simply be swallowed by someone to gain the effect (however, doing so doesn't infuse the sobering effect for one minute as it would to a gun it was fired from).
- **Soul-Killing Round:** Level 1d6. Form: "ETERNAL DEATH" scribed on bullet case. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. The target takes damage normally, or takes 2 additional points of damage if the cypher is level 5 or higher. If the target is killed by a gun infused with a soul-killing round, their soul is destroyed permanently. That goes for demons and other animating spirits as well as for people. For instance, if a demon in stolen flesh is killed, there's no need to salt and burn the body, because the demonic presence is erased, as opposed to merely being banished.
- **Sympathy Slug:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: "SYMPATHY" scribed on bullet case. Effect: Firing the round causes the gun to emit a spray of pleasingly colored lights, sounds, and scents filling a short area for one hour per cypher level. All positive interaction tasks made in the area gain an asset. Creatures who've made up their minds about a topic may be open to revisiting the issue. PCs add +1 to recovery rolls made in the area.
- **Thunder Slug:** Level 1d6. Form: Rumbles faintly like distant thunder. Effect: Firing the slug creates a region of hazed, billowing air from which the sound of distant thunder rumbles. The region fills an adjacent short area (or long area if the cypher is level 5 or higher) and lasts for about a minute. Any creature that enters (or begins their turn in) the area is blasted with bone-rattling thunder and takes 1 point of damage.
- **Unraveling Round:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Gray and corroded-looking bullet; leaves an ashy streak in the air when fired. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. If an object no larger than a 10-foot (3 m) cube is targeted, the object descends two steps on the object damage track if the object's level is equal to or less than this cypher's. (The object is immediately destroyed if its level is less than half the cypher's level.) If a creature is targeted, successful attacks made against the creature with unraveling rounds ignore its Armor.
- **Wanted Slug:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: "WANTED" scribed on bullet case. Effect: The bullet only fires if aimed at a WANTED poster. Assuming the poster is hit (a routine task if within short range and nothing else is distracting the shooter) the spent shell gains a special resonance with the creature indicated on the poster. If the spent slug is collected, it acts like a soul magnet, pulling in the direction of the individual shown on the poster, no matter how far away they are. The holder of the slug also has a general sense of how far their quarry is—somewhere in the same building, somewhere in town, miles away, hundreds of miles away, etc. The spent slug retains this affinity for a number of days equal to the cypher's level.
- **Washing Round:** Level 1d6. Form: "BATH" scribed on bullet case; leaves a sudsy, fresh-smelling streak in the air when fired. Effect: When this round is fired from a gun, additional attacks made from the gun gain the same benefit for the next minute. Instead of taking damage, a successfully attacked target is immediately subject to a good scrubbing, leaving them and their clothes a bit damp, but clean and as odor-free as if they'd washed and laundered in the finest bathhouse. If the cypher is level 5 or higher, the effect is so potent that the target's positive interaction tasks are eased for an hour afterward.
- **Watcher Slug:** Level 1d6 + 3. Form: "SEE UNSEEN" scribed on bullet case. Effect: When a watcher slug is fired (whether as an attack or just into the air), the shooter immediately gains the ability to perceive creatures and objects within long range whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's that are normally invisible, out of phase, only partially in the same realm, hiding, or merely under partial physical cover for one minute.

#### Alchemical Round Fusion Effect

If a gun fires an alchemical round that infuses it with a magical effect while the weapon is still infused with the effect of a previous alchemical round, the result of the fusion is random and unstable, as follows.

| d20 | Fusion Effect |
|:--:|----|
| 1 | Both infusion benefits are canceled in an alchemical blast dealing a number of points of damage equal to the levels of both cyphers to the wielder and everyone in immediate range on a failed Speed defense roll, or 3 points even with a successful roll. |
| 2 | The wielder is affected—no defense roll—as if targeted by an attack made by one of the infusions, and both infusion benefits are canceled. |
| 3 | The wielder is affected—no defense roll—as if targeted by an attack made by both of the infusions, and both infusion benefits are canceled. |
| 4 | Both infusion benefits are canceled and the gun melts into a lump of slag. |
| 5 | One infusion benefit is canceled (GM decides); gun wielder is stunned for one round. |
| 6–8 | The previous benefit is canceled, but the new one functions normally; gun wielder is dazed for one round. |
| 9–10 | One infusion benefit is canceled (GM decides); gun wielder is not adversely affected. |
| 11–19 | Both infusions work without interaction. |
| 20 | Both infusions work without interaction, and the duration of both is increased to ten minutes. |

NPCs

People from Native Nations are also doctors, hunters, trappers, celebrities, and so on within their own communities, as well as being part of the larger example setting The Ghost Range. Their individual fashion, gear, and weapons reflect their own cultural norms, adopt cowboy garb, or most often, represent a fusion.

**Rancher:** level 2, animal husbandry as level 4

**Settler:** level 2, homesteading as level 3

**Soldier:** level 2, initiative as level 4; rifle deals 4 points of damage

### Celebrities

A celebrity NPC is someone whose fame gives them an outsize ability to command the attention of regular folks.Their reputation probably accrued thanks to stories of actual (or made‑up) daring deeds, their particular personality, or some combination of both. For instance, some celebrities are gunfighters who earned their reputation through gunplay, which means some number of weird west celebrities are antiheroes, though marshals and lawmen balance that trope.

Another sort of weird west celebrity are folks about whom stories are told, or who tell those stories themselves, which makes them entertainers and performers of a sort. Whether holding forth in a saloon or showcasing their roping, pistol, bow, or other impressive skill, these celebrities are recognized locally and enjoy a few related benefits.

Effect: Apply the following stat adjustments to a celebrity.

• The NPC’s positive interaction tasks (or intimidation tasks, if an antihero) are eased by two steps

• The NPC can “captivate with starshine”: for as long as they speak, they keep the attention of all level 2 or lower NPCs who can hear them.

Celebrity Names: For a weird west setting, celebrities may be actual historical celebrities, or have names that merely evoke them, like the following.

Belle Younger, Rainmaker, Calamity Anne, Massad Masterson, Evangeline Oakley, Doc Festival, Midday Thunder, Blackjack Cassidy, Wong Starr, Polly McGraw, Grizzlyhawk, Diamond Larue, Kieu the Kid

#### Alchemist 5 (15)

Alchemists ain’t afraid to use logic and laborious experiments to claw magic from the dirt. Their knowledge of alchemical lore allows them to imbue inert objects with arcane volatility. They employ tinctures that heal or control, fling powders that explode or transform, and most impressively, animate rude substances into pseudo‑living entities known as forgeborn. Many alchemists pursue their craft merely from a desire to push back the boundaries of ignorance. Others have a specific goal in mind, such as to gain riches or power, to bring back a loved one, or merely to make a friend.

**GM intrusion:** The alchemist’s round has a chemical load that expands and hardens when exposed to air, trapping the target in the resulting crust until they can escape.

**Motive:** Use alchemy to achieve their ends

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 6 due to their forgeborn companion; alchemical knowledge as level 7

**Combat:** Alchemists use long range pistols or rifles. At least one of their bullets may be alchemical (see GM intrusion as an example).

**A forgeborn assistant also accompanies most alchemists, often helping with defense. Forgeborn assistant:** level 3; health 15; Armor 1 Especially accomplished alchemists may have a far more powerful forgeborn assistant, such as a deadshot or angalith.

A given alchemist also has one or two of the following alchemical resources available in combat.

- Empower: The alchemist uses a tincture to regain 11 points of health and gain +3 to Armor for one minute (or gives this tincture to an ally).

- Petrify: The alchemist flings a powder that turns up to two targets in immediate range to stone on a failed Might defense roll. Targets remain stone for one minute, then regain their flesh.

- Flummox: The alchemist flings a powder causing two targets in immediate range to randomly attack their allies on a failed Intellect defense roll. Affected targets remain flummoxed for one minute or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn.

- Blast: The alchemist flings a flask a short range that detonates in an acidic blast on impact, dealing damage to all creatures in an immediate area on a failed Speed defense roll, or 1 point of damage on a successful roll.

- Non-Combat Alchemy: A given alchemist could create tinctures able to revive the recently dead, animate dead flesh, transform lead into gold, and so on, if given many hours or days.

**Interaction:** Few alchemists can resist talking about their research and the wonders of magic that “natural philosophy” can unlock, regardless of their larger goals.

**Use:** The PCs need to revive an unresponsive forgeborn to learn what it knows, which means they need to find an alchemist.

**Loot:** An alchemist may have a couple of useful items (roll twice on the Alchemical Rounds and Slugs table), assuming they didn’t use them in combat.

### Cursed Beasts

Cursed beasts are often hybrid animals, a fusion of two or more different beasts stitched together with dire sorcery, or a combination of beast and base material (such as snow and dead flesh). Other times they’re ancient creatures time would’ve been better off forgetting.

Mysterious things, cursed beasts are often capable of coming and going as they please. In some times and places, they are called “cryptids” because at their core, they seem unknowable. Cursed beasts include dire coyotes, frostwalkers, hellfire steeds, and sulfur stalkers.

Chupacabra: Part huge dog, part crocodile; quilled like a porcupine.

Level 3, Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness, stealth and perception as level 7; health 13; Armor 2; bites for 5 points of damage; long‑range quill attack puts target to sleep for one hour on a failed difficulty 5 Might defense roll (target can try to wake each round)

Quetzalsaur: Giraffe‑sized monstrosity with a 40‑foot (12 m) wingspan.

Level 6, Speed defense as level 4 due to size; health 33; Armor 2; flies a long distance each round; beak attack for 7 points of damage; vomits up two zombie helpers (corpses of past victims) once per conflict

Grizzly Bull: Bison bull magically crossed with a grizzly bear.

Level 6, Speed defense as level 5 due to size, breaking through walls as level 8; health 28; Armor 1; horns attack deal 6 points of damage; if a foe within immediate range misses the bull, the grizzly bull gets an immediate extra attack

Deathtumbler: Human‑sized tumbleweeds whose “thorns” are actually animal fangs.

Level 3, Speed defense as level 4, disguise (as rotting carrion) as level 6; slashes with toothed branches for 3 points of damage; mundane attacks against deathtumbler deal only 1 point of damage each; attacks all targets in immediate area if it has surprise, dealing damage and, on a failed Might defense roll, 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores Armor)

Jackalope: Jackrabbit with the horns of an antelope.

Level 2, Speed defense as level 4, stealth and illusions as level 5; moves a long distance each round, immediate when burrowing; gores with antlers for 3 points of damage; creates illusion that can fill a short area and lasts for ten minutes or until interacted with

Nightcrawler: 20‑foot (6 m) long earthworm with skin stripped from past prey.

Level 4, Speed defense as level 3; bite deals 5 points of damage

#### Dire Coyote 4 (12)

Remnants of ancient populations reinvigorated by cursed magic, dire coyotes hunt lost and isolated creatures, regardless of whether the prey is alive or already dead. Dire coyotes are gaunt and sinewy, almost as large as a horse. Their hides are branded with arcane sigils that still glow and smoke with the sorcery that pulses through them.

Dire coyotes usually hunt in teams of two or three. However, their howls give the impression of a far larger number of individuals in the night.

**Motive:** Hungers for flesh, defense

**Environment:** Almost anywhere dark and isolated or near places ghosts haunt, individually and in teams of two or three

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Perception as level 6; attacks and defense against ghosts, wraiths, and other spirits as level 6

**Combat:** A dire coyote bites each round.

A dire coyote also has one or more of the following traits.

- Forlorn Howl: The dire coyote unleashes a forlorn howl that magically resonates within an adjacent short area (no more than once every few minutes). Creatures in the area take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor), causing them to run terrified in a random direction determined by the GM for several minutes, unless they succeed on an Intellect defense roll to end the effect early.

- Ghost eater: A dire coyote’s attacks affect incorporeal ghosts, wraiths, and similar spirits. If a dire coyote destroys a ghost or wraith, that usually ends the haunting, even if the spirit normally returns. Destroying a ghost heals a dire coyote to full health, but afterward the dire coyote must sleep for a few hours to “digest” the essence.

- Ignite Gun: If a dire coyote is damaged by a gun attack (or bow, or similar mechanism), the gun wielder must immediately succeed on an Intellect defense roll or their gun ignites, burning anyone holding it for 4 points of damage each round for three rounds.

**Interaction:** Dire coyotes have a secret language and society, but usually present to outsiders as just particularly dangerous coyotes. However, if they wish, dire coyotes can speak with the voice and memories of any ghost they have personally destroyed.

**Use:** A sheriff who posted a bounty on dire coyotes has gone missing, and their spouse needs someone to go find them.
**GM intrusion:** The dire coyote takes on the likeness of a ghost of someone the character knew—the ghost is someone the dire coyote has recently destroyed

#### Frostwalker 3 (9)

A frostwalker is a cursed beast made of packed snow layered over the severed limbs, heads, gristle, antlers, and sinew from deer, wolves, and sometimes people who’ve died in the cold. As such, they vary in appearance. Some are about the size of wolves, others are human‑sized with antlers, and a few—especially those with more limbs and/or heads than normal—can be up to twice the size of a person.

Frostwalkers may be creations of dire sorcery, though some gain motive force from the spirits of blizzards, ice, and enmity earned through past atrocity.

**Motive:** Revenge

**Environment:** Almost anywhere cold enough for snow and ice

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Perception as level 5

**Combat:** Frostwalkers bite, gore, or claw with whatever body part they have available.

Frostwalkers may also have one or more of the following abilities.

- Frozen: The frostwalker regains 1 point of health for each point of damage they would otherwise take from cold. In freezing temperatures and lower, they regain 1 point of health each round (assuming they’re not destroyed).

- Scream the Blizzard: The frostwalker can expel screaming cold winds (no more than once every few minutes), filling an adjacent short area. Creatures in the area take 4 points of ambient damage from the cold and, on a failed Might defense roll, are frozen in place for one minute or until they succeed on a Might‑based roll as their action. Even a successful Might defense roll dazes the target with cold, hindering their tasks for one minute.

- Small and Quick: About the size of a wolf, this frostwalker only has 1 Armor but can move a long distance each round.

- Snow Monster: Twice the size of a person, this frostwalker might have two or more heads (one wolf, one deer) and extra arms. It attacks twice per round, moves an immediate distance each round, and has 24 health.

**Interaction:** Frostwalkers are usually made (or form spontaneously) to enact vengeance or to attack a foe, and will do so until they’re destroyed.

**Use:** When the lake freezes over, monstrous things made of snow slide across the solid surface and begin terrorizing whatever they find.

Frostwalkers could be classified as necrovores instead of (or in addition to) cursed beasts, or possibly even as a forgeborn variety. Creature classification isn’t as neat and tidy as some alchemists might wish.

**GM intrusion:** An important piece of the character’s equipment freezes solid, rendering it unusable until it’s thawed.

#### Hellfire Steed 5 (15)

Intermittently ridden straight out of Hell by demons wearing borrowed flesh, the Damned, and others seeking to escape the accursed underworld, hellfire steeds are demonic, fire‑dripping destriers. Their manes are boiling napalm, their glowing red hooves leave prints that burn and smolder for days, and a single demonic horn curls from their brows. Once free of Hell, these steeds typically buck their riders and race off across the prairielands, setting blazes as they go, apparently seeking to wreak as much havoc as they can before they’re reclaimed by Hell.

**Motive:** Havoc and suffering

**Environment:** Almost anywhere; sometimes ridden as a mount by the powerful or foolish

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Armor:** 1 (10 against fire)

**Combat:** Hellfire steeds attack twice each round with their horn.

Hellfire steeds also have one or more of the following traits.

- Fires of the Underworld: Anyone not chosen as a rider by the hellfire steed that ends a turn within immediate range of the creature takes 2 points of damage from hellish heat.

- Lifedraining Horn: The hellfire steed deals an additional 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) with its horn attack once every few minutes, gaining that drained life as health.

- Render Immune to Fire: If the hellfire steed is compelled or agrees to serve as a mount, the steed’s rider takes no damage from the steed’s Fires of the Underworld and gains +2 Armor against fire from other sources while riding.

- From Hell: Once per year, a hellfire steed can emerge from or enter Hell through a transitory portal, bearing riders if it chooses.
Death Gallop: If killed, a hellfire steed’s body animates one last time, galloping a long distance before turning to ash. Everyone along its final route takes 5 points of fire damage on a failed Speed defense roll.

**Interaction:** Though usually driven by demonic desire, hellfire steeds are fully sapient and can speak all languages. They may negotiate with someone seeking to use them as a mount, but only in return for a promise of committing atrocities.

**Use:** Stuck in Hell or a similarly hellish place, characters may have to ask a hellfire steed for a ride out.

**Loot:** A hellfire steed’s horn is a sought‑after alchemist ingredient; a full horn is a very expensive item.
**GM intrusion:** The steed decides it no longer wants the character as a rider and takes back their immunity to fire.

#### Sulfur Stalker 5 (15)

Dwelling in steaming, acidic hot springs, sulfur stalkers’ umbral, scaled bodies can reach lengths of 10 or more feet (3 m). Their broad, flat heads feature wide, gaping mouths filled with rows of sharp teeth. Feathery tendrils fringe their heads, twining and stretching as if of their own accord. Powerful clawed limbs and an eel‑like tail mean they’re equally adept on land and in liquid—even boiling hot, acrid springs. The overpowering smell of sulfur—like rotten eggs—precedes and follows them.

Sulfur stalkers periodically emerge from their pools and migrate long distances, presumably to mate. During this migration, they grow ravenously hungry, preying on anything. They also drag away people, which they feed to their newly hatched young.

**Motive:** Defense, gather food for newly hatched young

**Environment:** Anywhere near hot springs, or anywhere during seasons of migration

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Armor:** 2 (5 against fire; immune to acid)

**Movement:** Short; swims a short distance each round

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to size; stealth as level 6

**Combat:** Sulfur stalkers bite.

Additional sulfur stalker abilities include one or more of the following.

- Tendril Aura: Any creature that begins their turn within immediate range of a sulfur stalker must succeed on a Speed defense roll or be grazed by a feathery tendril for 3 points of damage from dripping acid.

- Acid Geyser: A boiling‑hot acid stream sprays all creatures in a short‑range line, dealing 9 points of damage on a failed Speed defense roll, and 2 points of damage even if successful. (The sulfur stalker can’t make this attack more than once every few minutes.)

- Regrow: If damaged, a sulfur stalker regains 2 health each round on any round it hasn’t taken damage from cold or magic. This ability is so pernicious that an entirely new sulfur stalker could grow from a severed portion.

**Interaction:** Sulfur stalkers have a language, and some can speak human tongues, especially those that have made deals with locals. Such deals usually involve turning over some number of other people each year for the stalker to eat—culled from a local jail, taken in outlaw raids, etc.

**Use:** A bounty for sulfur stalker eggs is so generous that folks everywhere begin hunting. This riles up the local stalker population, who begin attacking towns and homesteads preemptively.

**Loot:** Because sulfur stalkers tend to capture people to feed their young, cast‑off belongings can sometimes be found in their nests—which are well‑hidden locations near hot springs, but not under them. In addition, a nest might contain an egg or two, each equal in value to an expensive item.
**GM intrusion:** A severed segment of a sulfur stalker animates as a half‑size, level 3 sulfur stalker that attacks the character. The stalker might have to bite off its tail to start this process

### Forgeborn

Forgeborn—also called golems—are animate figures of metal, reanimated flesh, or other normally inert materials. They are constructed for a specific purpose; an angalith is usually

sent to punish or guard, and inkubuses are commonly seeded as spies or assassins.

Most forgeborn have the following traits:

- Dim: Most forgeborn (though there are many exceptions) aren’t quick thinkers; their

- Intellect defense against being tricked or mentally attacked is level 2.

- Temperamental: A forgeborn can break free of the spells that bind them to service for brief periods. This happens automatically two rounds after the forgeborn fails an Intellect defense roll against an attack or attempt to control them. The triggered forgeborn attacks twice each round for two or three rounds, choosing targets indiscriminately but preferring anyone who attempted to control them.

- Resistant: Forgeborn cannot be stunned or dazed. They are immune to most poisons and disease.

- Quiet: Most forgeborn can’t speak (but some can).

Locomotem: 20‑foot (6 m) tall humanoid figure fabricated from a coal‑fed train engine.

Level 6, Speed defense as level 4 due to size; health 30; Armor 5; steam whistle (once per hour) stuns creatures in immediate range on failed Might defense roll

Fleshmare: Made from the stitched‑together flesh of deceased horses.

Level 4; health 24; Armor 3; hoof attack deals 6 points of damage; electrical damage heals instead of harms fleshmare

Alchehemoth: 10‑foot (3 m) tall humanoid figure fabricated from a metallic whiskey still.

Level 5, Speed defense as level 4 due to size; health 27; fists deal 7 points of damage; inebriating breath causes creatures in immediate range to fall into booze‑fueled slumber for one hour on failed Might defense roll

#### Angalith 5 (15)

An angalith—a forgeborn fabricated from prismatic stained glass windows taken from cathedrals and churches—is a 15‑foot (4.5 m) tall figure.
**Motive:** Follow the will of their creator (but actually, break the control of their creator or whoever has control over them; see Temperamental)

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 27

**Damage Inflicted:** 7 points

**Armor:** 3

**Movement:** Short; long when flying

**Modifications:** Intellect defense as level 2; Speed defense as level 4 due to size

**Combat:** Angaliths slice foes with jagged edges of their stained glass wings.

Angaliths have the following additional abilities and traits.

- Prismatic Blaze: Six prismatic shafts of light shine from the angalith’s core as their action, illuminating the sins of all creatures within short range (no more than once each minute). A given target is subject to only one shaft of light, which they must make an Intellect defense roll to resist. Choose or roll for which sin is brought to light for each target.

1.  Red (Wrath): Target attacks an ally on their next turn.

2.  Orange (Envy): Target throws mud/dung/etc. in the face of an ally on their next turn.

3.  Yellow (Apathy): Target sits down and stares into space on their next turn.

4.  Green (Greed): Target attempts to steal something from an ally on their next turn.

5.  Blue (Gluttony): Target chows down nearest food—or goes looking for some—on their next turn.

6.  Indigo (Pride): Target sniffs disdainfully and walks away from the combat on their next turn.

- Forgeborn Traits: Angaliths are Dim, Temperamental, Resistant, and Quiet.

**Interaction:** Angaliths resonate with the worship and faith their component parts once witnessed. Often, that faith was preaching about the welfare of other beings, so they may stop to help those in need. But if they see someone act against the common good, in an angalith’s estimation, that someone is due only hellfire.

**Use:** Angaliths—like most forgeborn—are tough encounters even for those who are tooled up for a fight. However, they can be assuaged with promises of saintly acts or demonstrations of good works, which could turn an angry angalith found in a demolished church into a temporary ally.

**GM intrusion:** The character sliced by the jagged edge of a stained glass wing begins bleeding for 1 ambient damage each round until someone succeeds on a difficulty 3 healing task to stop the flow.

#### Inkubus 4 (12)

An inkubus enjoys two different states of being. One is as an alchemically marked‑up page, whether that’s a sheet in a book or newspaper, a letter, a broadsheet, or a wanted poster. There’s little to distinguish this inkubus “seed” from regular paper without a concerted search for magical influence. Each seed has a trigger, set by the alchemist who created it. The trigger could be when the page is read, when a certain amount of time is expired, when a specified individual sees the page, or something else.

A triggered inkubus takes on substance either immediately, as nearby paper swirls in and accretes around the seed, or gradually, if the inkubus is meant to remain unobtrusive (as often happens when the seed is a wanted poster whose target just wandered by).

When fully embodied, an inkubus appears as a human‑sized dragonfly‑like paper sculpture covered in constantly scrolling words.

**Motive:** As determined when seeded (but actually, break the control of their creator or whoever has control over them; see Temperamental)

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 21

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short; long when flying

**Modifications:** Stealth as level 8 (when not fully manifest)

**Combat:** Inkubuses slice targets with knife‑sharp paper cuts as their attack.

Inkubuses may have one or more of the following additional traits, depending on their purpose.

- Word of Power: An inkubus contains a “word of power” that it can display as an action once per day. A target in short range who sees it and fails an Intellect defense roll is affected as indicated for one minute (or longer for Forget):

- Stunned: Target takes no action.

- Confess: Target starts with their most egregious crimes/secrets, one per turn.

- Betray: Target attacks nearby allies.

- Forget: Target goes back to whatever they were doing and doesn’t remember meeting the inkubus unless or until they meet again.

- Words on the Floor: The inkubus can send written words to their creator (or anyone), such as a warning, an update on their status, or some other predetermined signal. Words appear on a surface near the creator.

- Forgeborn Traits: Inkubuses are Resistant and Temperamental.

**Interaction:** The inkubus is more self‑aware than most other forgeborn, and may interact with characters by using its Words on the Floor ability.

**Use:** The PCs receive a letter from a famous alchemist, which becomes an inkubus that relays the alchemist’s message (an invitation, a warning, a threat, or something else).

**GM intrusion:** Important documents or other papers the character carries flap away and become part of the inkubus.

### Gunfighters

Gunfighters live and die by their six‑chambered peacemakers using a threatened—or actual—lightning‑quick draw to accomplish their aims. Most gunfighters are regular folks who practice their craft so diligently that they become the best, at least until they measure themselves against a desperado who’s a smidge faster. Most gunfighters in a weird west setting have a bit of the supernatural about them, but one variety of gunfighter, known as a hex gunner, explicitly mixes magic with bullets.

Bounty hunter: Figure in sleek, form‑fitting dark duster and wide‑brimmed hat with twin guns.

Level 4; tracking, surveillance, stealth, and disguise as level 6; health 15; Armor 1; attacks twice with long‑range pistol; a melee attack with locking cuffs (level 5) binds target to a nearby large object on a failed Speed defense roll

Deadshot: Eight-foot (3 m) figure stitched together from the reanimated flesh of deceased gunslingers.

Level 5; initiative as level 8; health 27; Armor 4; long‑range pistol attack deals 7 points of damage; once a minute fires necrotic bullet that deals 3 points of damage each round (ignores Armor) until bullet extracted with a difficulty 4 healing task

Gunslinger: Grim‑faced pistoleer pursuing vengeance, doing crime, or making a name for themself.

Level 4, initiative as level 7; health 18; Armor 1; long‑range pistol attack deals 6 points of damage (or 8 points with eased attack if they attack before their foe); every hit increases damage by 1 point for the rest of the encounter (to a maximum of +10)

Lawman: Driven by a dream of justice, a lawman enforces rules even when no one else will.

Level 5, Might defense as level 6; health 20; Armor 1; long‑range rifle attacks; the first time a lawman would normally succumb to their wounds (having lost all their health), they instead gain a second wind (and 10 health); banishing rounds deal full damage to ghosts and similarly protected creatures

#### Hex Gunner 5 (15)

Hex gunners weave iron and lead with Hellish sorcery. Gifts from a demon gained during a crossroads deal, a hex gunner’s six‑shooters are demonic constructs that grant the equivalent of years of practice and occult study. Their bullets whisper in the chamber, smoking with necromancy, then scream with exultant, hellish fury when fired. Each round is imbued with fragments of souls from those the hex gunner has previously defeated in gunfights.

Hex gunners may be pledged to a literal lord of Hell (or some other occult being of damnation and pain, such as a ghost rider). Only if they harvest a certain number of souls during their gunfighting career is their own soul safe from being claimed when their life ends. That value may be visible as a glowing number burning in their eyes.

**Motive:** Reap souls for Hell

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 23

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short; long while riding a horse

**Modifications:** Initiative as level 7

**Combat:** A hex gunner makes two long‑range pistol attacks as their action.

A hex gunner also has one or both of the following abilities.

- Hell‑Hexed Rounds: A bullet that deals damage stays in the wound on a hit, cursing the target until the bullet is surgically removed (each requiring a successful difficulty 6 healing task and inflicting 1 point of ambient damage). Curses vary, including:

- Soul of damned previous target possesses the new target once per day for one minute on a failed Intellect defense roll. Possessing spirit may work against target, or simply take off seeking some goal of their own.

- Wound leaks a horrific smell and discharge; target’s pleasant interaction tasks are hindered by two steps.

- Target’s GM intrusion range increases by 1 until bullet is removed.

- Grave Round: If they shoot a corpse, the corpse rises as a zombie that serves the hex gunner for a day. During this period, the zombie can reveal secrets it knew in life to the hex gunner.

**Interaction:** Hex gunners are mainly concerned with reaping more souls for whoever they are pledged to. Usually, they prefer those souls be already tainted by evil, but hex gunners are angry and impatient as a rule and have nearly as little sympathy for the innocent as they do for the damned.

**Use:** PCs need information from someone who died. They learn that a “hex gunner” who dwells nearby may be able to communicate with the body.

**GM intrusion:** The hex gunner releases a demon from their gun that immediately attacks the character

### Necrovore

Necrovores—otherwise known as undead—are what some call those that feed on death, those that are dead but still move, those that feed on life, and all things that lie somewhere in between. Now, some might quibble about using “necrovore” for such a wide range of creatures. But does it make a lick of difference if you call a shade of the tomb—a wraith that takes form from a gravestone’s shadow—a necrovore, a demon, or an undead when it’s draining all joy from existence? Nope. Same holds true for a deathbinder, hollowed ranger, risen (also called Damned), and tombdrift.

Ghost Rider: Harbingers of chaos and catastrophe, ghost riders spread havoc long past their deaths.

Level 6; health 20; Armor 1; rides a skeletal mount a long distance each round; long‑range pistol attack deals 6 damage; short‑range curse causes target who fails an Intellect defense roll to lose their next turn as they freeze in terror
**Wraith Lord:** A malign artifact or especially powerful curse may form an exceptional wraith.

Level 5, stealth as level 6; health 22; Armor 1; flies a short distance each round (or is mounted on a quetzalsaur); spectral weapon deals 6 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and induces target to fall one step on the damage track each day a Might defense roll fails (three successes purge the effect); if destroyed, a wraith usually reforms the following midnight

Zombie sorcerer: Magic‑infused corpse that knows enough sorcery to be dangerous.

Level 4; health 18; moves an immediate distance each round; long‑range necrotic blast deals 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) to all in an immediate area, or 1 point even with a successful defense roll; even‑numbered attack rolls that would reduce its health to 0 reduce health to 1 instead

DEATHBINDER 7(21)

Alchemists who learn enough science and magic to retain corporeal existence after death, like risen, might transition to necrovore status. Unlike a risen, a deathbinder ensures their eternal existence by placing splinters of their soul into six bullets chambered in a “soul pistol.” If all six bullets are fired, the deathbinder is finally destroyed.

Two pistols are holstered on a deathbinder’s gun belt: the deathbinder’s soul pistol, which they reserve for special circumstances, and their “workaday” six‑shooter, loaded with unique alchemical rounds.

A deathbinder usually resides alone, herding cursed beasts or forgeborn creatures of their own creation, probably astride a fleshmare.

**Motive:** Continue alchemical studies and magical collection without interruption

**Environment:** Wilderness, ghost towns, and other underpopulated areas

**Health:** 27

**Damage Inflicted:** 7 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short

**Combat:** A deathbinder attacks twice each round with long‑range pistol attacks.

The deathbinder also has most or all of the following attacks and traits.

- Alchemical Pistol: Targets hit by a “workaday” pistol shot take damage and, on a failed Might or Intellect defense roll, suffer one additional effect:

- Target is frozen in amber until they can escape.

- Deathbinder learns one of the target’s secrets.

- Target is teleported to a pre‑prepared nearby location.

- Soul Pistol: Under extreme circumstances, a deathbinder may fire a precious bullet from their soul pistol, hoping they’ll have a chance later to rebind the liberated soul energy. A bullet from the soul gun has all of the following deadly traits:

- Automatically hits target within long range—a targeted PC should get a GM intrusion for this attack.

- The soul round deals damage and the character descends two steps on the damage track, or one step on a successful Might defense roll.

- Target is cursed on a failed Intellect defense roll.

- Alchemical Resurrection: If destroyed, a deathbinder usually reforms within 1d6 days unless all six bullets from their soul pistol are fired.

**Interaction:** Deathbinders don’t cotton to interruptions because the reason they chose undeath in the first place was to pursue a specialized purpose—usually, even deeper secrets of alchemy and/or collecting more unique magical artifacts and treasures.

**Use:** A herd of ghost cattle wanders into town and causes problems. Folks say it’s the fault of the “lich cowboy” who lives out in the wastes.

**Loot:** The deathbinder’s pistols have uniquely powerful rounds loaded in them; roll once on the Alchemical Rounds and Slugs table.

**GM intrusion:** The deathbinder makes an extra pistol attack even if it’s not their turn.

#### Hollowed Ranger 4 (12)

Cloaked in a tattered duster and riding nothing but a memory, the necrovore known as a hollowed ranger is a traveling portal to elsewhere—perhaps connecting to a nightmare, the far future after everyone has died, or some region of Hell where corpses shamble beneath an eternal eclipse.

Hollowed rangers ride forth where good people were gunned down in cold blood and then dumped in shallow, unmarked graves. The injustice rips a hole in the world, which the murdered spirit possesses and becomes. Unfortunately, a hollowed ranger’s desire for vengeance doesn’t restrict them from visiting horror on most everything they encounter.

**Motive:** Vengeance (first against their killer, then their killer’s family and friends, then their killer’s species, and so on)

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 6 due to partially non‑existent body

**Combat:** A hollowed ranger’s long‑range entropic bullet—fired from a rifle‑shaped hole in reality—deals 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) as a bit of the target’s reality is blasted away.

A hollowed ranger also has the following traits.

- Necrovore Door: As their action, the ranger shudders as a wraith lord emerges from their body, acting as the ranger wishes for one minute. After one minute, the wraith is drawn back into the ranger, or it just fades. (Other necrovores could instead be called from the deathly realms a hollowed ranger is connected to, but anything level 3 or higher takes two actions to disgorge.)

- Fall Into Oblivion: On a failed Might defense roll, a living creature starting their turn in immediate range of a hollowed ranger is sucked through the hollowed ranger’s form into the deathly realm beyond. This realm is anathema to life—the affected target immediately takes 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) from the necrotic energy draining their soul. Affected targets are drained of life each additional round they spend in the deathly realm, but can attempt a Might‑based task to pull themselves back to their reality. The hollowed ranger regains 1 point of health each time an affected target’s soul is so drained.

- Door Shift: A hollowed ranger can instantly transport themself miles away as its action, if they have previously been to or seen the other location.

**Interaction:** Speaking with a voice like wind on gravestones, a hollowed ranger may tell of the primary target of their vengeance, deliver a message from a more powerful necrovore, or simply promise to eat the soul of whoever tries negotiating with them.

**Use:** Characters need to travel a huge distance and are told the quickest way is to use the door shift offered by a hollowed ranger, though doing so will require appeasing the ranger in some way.

**GM intrusion:** The character drawn through the hollowed ranger’s form to a deathly realm is attacked by a ghost lurking there.

#### Risen 4 (12)

Clawed back into “life” thanks to a promise, an alchemical experiment, or a demonic curse straight out of Hell, risen look normal enough—from a distance. Up close, something ain’t right. That’s all the more obvious if the risen is someone folks knew before they died.

Risen—also known as the Damned—spook horses and set dogs to growling. They have unblinking eyes like coins and skin the color of a snake’s belly, and are naturally as motionless as a corpse when not engaged in an activity. A risen may just want to be left alone, or they could seek to right a wrong, serve as a deathbinder’s herald, or ride in an undead posse looking to take as much as they can from a world they know would just as soon put them back in their grave.

**Motive:** Varies

**Environment:** Out-of-the-way places

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short

**Combat:** A risen makes a long‑range pistol attack.

Risen also have one or more of the following additional traits.

- Damned Rounds: Every other attack against PCs is Hell‑tainted, blazing with hellfire. If one of these bullets strikes true, the target combusts for an additional 3 points of damage (ignores Armor) each round until an action is taken to smother the flames.

- Necrovore Resilience: The first time in an encounter that a risen would normally succumb to their wounds (having lost all their health), they instead remain active and regain 1 health.

- In addition, risen don’t breathe—drowning, suffocation, and similar threats don’t faze them.

- Sometimes They Come Back: A destroyed risen might reanimate within a few days, unless its head is removed from its body and separated by a couple of miles, or the body is burned to ash.

**Interaction:** Risen are rarely excitable; even those bent on mayhem are chillingly quiet as they murder and burn. Some risen are open to negotiation and alliances, while others would as soon shoot as talk.

**Use:** Folks are concerned because someone who looks a lot like Luke Reynolds has taken up farming at the old Reynolds place, even though outlaws killed the whole family.

**GM intrusion:** The character recognizes the risen as someone they personally killed and is dazed with surprise until the end of their next turn, hindering all tasks.

#### Tombdrift 5 (15)

Necrovore sand dunes 30 feet (9 m) in diameter are sometimes seeded from those who die in the desert and are buried only by shifting sands. When inactive, it’s nearly impossible to distinguish tombdrifts from regular desert dunes. But when one senses life, the necrovore rolls forward like a slow ocean wave, or alternatively, condenses into the shape of the spirit that seeded the undead thing. When assuming the echo of the person who seeded them, tombdrifts might speak. However, keeping such a shape requires energy—the assumed shape is constantly crumbling away and reforming, until it collapses once again into an unquiet, hungry dune.

**Motive:** Bury the living; feed on life

**Environment:** Desert and badlands

**Health:** 23

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Immediate (but see Dust Devil Speed)

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 2 due to size

**Combat:** The tombdrift abrades every creature in immediate range with scouring sand. The tombdrift is immune to poison, disease, and life‑draining effects.

They also have one or more of the following attacks and traits.

- Drain Life: One target damaged by the tombdrift is subject to life drain, taking 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) on a failed Might defense roll. In addition, the target is sickened until the end of their next turn, hindering all tasks. On a successful defense roll, the target still takes 1 point of Speed damage, but isn’t sickened.

- Dust Devil Speed: The tombdrift spins up into a dust devil of sand that speeds forward a long distance (no more than once every minute), attacking all creatures along the line of travel. On a failed Might defense roll, damaged targets are also blinded on their next turn.

- Sand Regeneration: Tombdrifts regain 1 health each round they are in a desert or badlands region, unless they’ve taken damage from banishing rounds or similar anti‑undead attacks (in which case they don’t begin regaining health again for a couple of minutes).

**Interaction:** When they take the echo of their former shape, tombdrifts can communicate in rasping voices, and may choose to negotiate with other creatures instead of draining their life. Tombdrifts may want their remains properly buried, or something else. Some tombdrifts don’t care or don’t remember their lives and simply wish to feed.

**Use:** A sandstorm blew through the town’s cemetery with enough force to rip graves out of the ground. Now, some drifts of sand left in the storm’s wake have started moving.

**Loot:** A tombdrift, which contains the remains of the individual who seeded it (maybe just a few eroded bones), might also have some of their belongings, such as a box with a few remaining alchemical rounds.

**GM intrusion:** The character is pulled into the dune and is crushed and suffocated for 5 points of ambient damage each round until they can escape with a Might‑based roll as their action.

#### Shade Of The Tomb 5 (15)

Though thankfully rare, shades of the tomb (commonly called “tomb shades”) may spontaneously manifest beneath the dull light of the Tomb Moon, taking form from gravestone shadows. Other times tomb shades are called into brief existence by a summoning spell. When they resolve, they regard the world with the head of an ink-beaked raven, with half a dozen clutching ebony arms emerging from their tenebrous cloak. If need be, a tomb shade can seep through cracks and around barriers that would stymie most corporeal beings.

**Motive:** Douse other beings’ light, life, and joy

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 20

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Short; short when climbing

**Modifications:** Stealth as level 7

**Combat:** A tomb shade’s touch drains life, inflicting Speed damage (ignores Armor).

In dim light and darkness, a tomb shade only takes 1 point of damage from successful attacks against them.

Individual tomb shades may also have one or more of the following abilities they can use as their action.

- Siphon: On a failed Might defense task, a short‑range necrotic ray deals 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), which the shade gains as health, up to their maximum.

- Darken: The shade summons magical darkness that blooms from a point within long range (no more than once every ten minutes). The darkness fills an area an immediate distance across and lasts for ten minutes. Even creatures that can normally see in darkness can’t see in this magical murk, except for tomb shades and undead.

- Anguish: The shade drains happiness and joy from all creatures within immediate range (no more than once per minute). Targets that fail an Intellect defense roll take 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and are disconsolate, losing their next turn. Each turn after that they can attempt another Intellect defense roll to regain their composure and act normally.

- Portal: The tomb shade dissolves, their animus departing (possibly back to the Tomb Moon). The resulting implosive burst of necrotic energy deals 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) to all creatures within immediate range that fail a Speed defense task. Damaged targets must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled partially through the portal, sustaining 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round from the necrotic contact until they can pull free with a successful Might roll as their action. When the last target pulls free (or dies and is pulled through), the portal closes.

> Interaction: Sinister and conniving, a tomb shade doesn’t speak, but uses its many arms for magical signing, usually only to make threats.

**Use:** An alchemist wants PCs to collect a cursed book for their library, but whenever someone opens the tome, shadows (a tomb shade) swallow the reader.


### Weird West Artifacts

The weird west artifacts described in this chapter include those created by alchemists, sorcerers, demons, and other supernatural beings, as well as a few leftover relics of an inhuman precursor species and their horrifying enemies.

If your setting doesn't include these specific concepts, reskin likely looking artifacts (and for that matter, cyphers noted in the previous section) to better fit your setting's history. For instance, if your weird west setting leans heavily into steampunk, maybe "engineers" create most of the fantastic options of the setting, so that instead of a "demon pistol" (a demon in the shape of a six-shooter), characters gain a "gauss pistol" that fires tiny steam-powered automatons into the target's flesh.

Some weapon artifacts are noted as potentially self-aware. Refer to the Self-Aware Artifacts section for what that could mean for a PC who acquires such an item.

| d00 | Artifact |
|-------|-------------------------|
| 01–04 | Conspicuous badge |
| 05–08 | Deck of second chances |
| 09–12 | Demon pistol |

- **Conspicuous Badge:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Sheriff's badge that always catches the light just right. Effect: If the wearer polishes, touches, or merely thinks about activating their worn and visible badge as part of a persuasion or intimidation task, the task is eased by two steps, or three steps if the artifact is level 5 or higher. Depletion: 1 in 1d10.
- **Deck of Second Chances:** Level 1d6. Form: Standard card deck; however, face cards take on strong resemblance to deck's current bearer. Alternate Form: Sometimes a deck of second chances becomes linked with a group instead of an individual bearer; in such cases, the face cards take on the resemblance of everyone in that group. Effect: Each time the bearer of the deck (or a member of a group linked to the deck) would otherwise die, a random card is drawn and disappears from the deck. The beneficiary of this effect immediately regains Pool points equal to the artifact's level they can allocate however they choose. In addition, different cards grant different effects, as follow. To determine the effect, draw a card from a standard card deck that includes jokers, or use the Midnight Deck. (If no deck is handy, the GM determines the card drawn.) A character can also choose to draw a card from the deck at any time (regardless of whether they face mortal peril), and gain the additional benefit noted for that card, if any.
  - *Number Card, Any Suite:* No additional effect other than the bearer's survival.
  - *Gears (Diamonds) Face Card:* In addition to the bearer surviving, they find a random expensive item in their possession.
  - *Guns (Clubs) Face Card:* In addition to the bearer surviving, they find their weapons and bandoliers fully loaded, including one random alchemical round.
  - *Elixirs (Hearts) Face Card:* In addition to the bearer surviving, they gain an alchemical protective sheen (granting them +1 to Armor) that lasts until midnight.
  - *Eyes (Spades) Face Card:* In addition to the bearer surviving, the creature responsible for almost killing the bearer takes a number of points of Intellect damage equal to the artifact's level.
  - *Ace, any Suit:* In addition to the bearer surviving, they gain a free level of Effort that they can apply to any task, which they must use before midnight.
  - *Jackalopes (Jokers):* Bearer survives, but instead of bouncing back, they are treated as if debilitated until they rest for ten hours.
  Depletion: 1 in 1d20.
- **Demon Pistol:** Level 1d6 + 3. Form: Six-gun-shaped demon; potentially self-aware. Effect: This firearm is often a heavy long-range weapon (but it can take on smaller form factors, becoming a medium or light pistol in the process). Attacks with the demon pistol are eased, or eased by two steps if a light pistol. If the shooter wishes, a successful hit causes the bullet lodged in the wound to transform into a tiny demonic imp (level 3) with mouths for eyes. The imp automatically deals 3 points of damage each round to the target until the target removes the imp with a successful Speed-based roll; once removed or a minute elapses, the transformation magic fades and the body is revealed as no more than a spent bullet. The shooter's attacks and defenses against demons are hindered while they bear this artifact. Depletion: 1 in 1d20.
- **Downtime Bandana:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Kerchief stitched with alchemical symbols. Effect: When the wearer pulls the bandana up over their mouth and nose as part of another action, time stops for everyone but them, allowing the wearer to act and/or move without interruption from outside forces for one full round (or for two full rounds if the artifact is level 7 or higher). Moving or damaging objects and creatures is possible for a wearer acting during an interval of stopped time, but doing so immediately ends that interval. Depletion: 1 in 1d6.
- **Everfull Shot Glass:** Level 1d6. Form: Shot glass with alchemist signature or mark. Effect: Once filled from a standard bottle of whiskey or other liquor, the shot glass refills itself with the same quality of liquor each time the previous shot is drained and the glass is set upright on a bar, table, or level surface. The drinker decides whether any given shot has the standard intoxicating effect, or if the shot has no effect whatsoever. Depletion: 1 in 1d00.
- **Hand of the Eclipse:** Level 10. Form: Sealed glass jar holding a child-sized mummified forearm and hand that clutches a corroded silver coin. Effect: User can summon the Tomb Moon into the sky if they spend several rounds concentrating to do so. The summoned Tomb Moon persists for 1d10 hours before returning to its previous chaotic orbit. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (upon depletion, user's soul is drained away by the Tomb Moon).
- **Illuck Stone:** Level 8. Form: Head-sized lump of crystal with red filaments running through it. Effect (Alien): Bearer rerolls 1s (NPC bearers avoid a stroke of bad luck). What's not immediately obvious—though may become so with experience—is that ill luck is visited upon someone close to the bearer, whether a friend or a stranger, often in the form of a freak accident that hurts or kills them, usually within a day, as the GM determines. Examples include slipping on a wet surface, falling into a sinkhole, or being gored by a runaway bull, all the way up to drawing the attention of something terrible. The GM determines the severity of the incident, but the level of the threat is commensurate with the artifact's level (level 8). The bearer can't choose not to reroll 1s as long as they bear the Illuck Stone. If the bearer tries to part ways with the stone, it somehow appears among their possessions again. Only by giving it to a new bearer can the old bearer part ways, though they become the first victim of bad luck when a new user would otherwise experience bad luck. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (upon depletion, recharged if brought into a proscribed zone).
- **Ilu Idol:** Level 6. Form: 2-inch (5 cm) tall figurine of a humanoid sitting cross-legged, densely etched with hieroglyphs. Effect (Alien): A successfully attacked target within short range whose level is equal to or less than the artifact's disappears; the target's essence is trapped in the artifact. If a previously trapped creature was already in the artifact, it appears where the newly trapped one was located. No time passes for a creature trapped in the artifact. The only way for a creature to escape is if the idol is destroyed, the idol's bearer wills the trapped creature free, or the bearer traps a new creature. Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check per successfully trapped creature; upon depletion, newly trapped creature remains trapped only for a few days before the fading magic releases them).
- **Lightning Eyes:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Glimmering pearl-sized crystal droplet. Effect (Alien): If the artifact's bearer is damaged by electricity, the bearer regains a number of Pool points equal to the damage the electricity would normally inflict. In addition, the wielder can throw a long-range lightning bolt as their action, attacking up to three creatures in a line in an electrical attack that deals damage equal to the artifact's level. Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, recharged if brought into a proscribed zone).
- **Magebreak Manacles:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Metal manacles etched with alchemical symbols. Effect: These manacles, which can be applied to both wrists of a willing or helpless target, hinder manual tasks by two steps (or four steps if the target's hands are manacled behind their back). In addition, the manacles prevent the use of alchemical, magical, or other uncanny abilities if the target's level is less than the artifact's. (PCs must succeed on an Intellect-based roll against the manacles' level before using a supernatural ability and, on a failed attempt, take Intellect damage [ignores Armor] equal to the manacles' level.) Depletion: 1 in 1d00 (check per day of use).
- **Nihilal Tendril Horn:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Ancient stone with a twisted, conical shape (vaguely horn-like), scribed with antediluvian etchings; potentially self-aware. Effect (Alien): If held like a weapon and activated by pointing the horn at a creature within long range, a writhing tendril is spat at the creature. If the targeted creature is hit with the attack, the target faces one of the following effects, different each time the horn is used. Other horns might spit tendrils with different effects, or do something else entirely. Depletion: 1 in 1d20.
  | d6 | Horn Effect |
  |---|---|
  | 1–4 | Tendril wraps target, preventing physical tasks and dealing damage equal to the artifact's level each round until the target escapes. Either way, tendril desiccates and turns to dust after about a minute. |
  | 5–6 | Tendril attempts to eat its way into target via mouth, ears, or eyes, inflicting damage equal to the artifact's level that ignores Armor. If the target survives, the tendril desiccates and turns to dust. If the damage kills the target, the tendril successfully enters the corpse. About a minute later, target's body tears open, and an awful thing emerges, which attacks the nearest living creature. |
  *Awful thing: level 5; health 18; attacks with toothed tentacles; where damaged, target's skin is discolored for several weeks*
- **Persuader:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Pistol studded with intimidating spikes; produces menacing vapor and/or growls when owner attempts to intimidate; potentially self-aware. Effect: This firearm is a medium long-range weapon (though lighter and heavier versions are possible). When the pistol is visible (even if still holstered), the shooter's intimidation tasks are eased by two steps. When the shooter wishes, a bullet fired from the gun that would otherwise strike a target instead hangs menacingly in front of the target's face, granting the shooter an immediate additional opportunity to intimidate the target, a task that gains an additional asset. After the intimidation attempt, the shooter decides whether to allow the hanging bullet to complete its trajectory and damage the target, or to fall harmlessly to the ground. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per menacing bullet fired); upon depletion, can still be used as a normal gun of its size.
- **Philosopher's Gun:** Level 1d6 + 3. Form: Oversize six-shooter-like glass gun featuring small reservoirs of multicolored fluids and vapors; potentially self-aware. Effect: This firearm is a medium long-range weapon. In addition, when triggered by its owner, the philosopher's gun synthesizes one variety of alchemical round and adds the round to the chamber; an attack using that round is available on the character's next turn. A typical philosopher's gun can only synthesize one type of alchemical round; however, if the artifact is level 7 or higher, two different round varieties may be synthesized, which the owner chooses between when triggering the synthesis. If the artifact is level 9, the gun synthesizes one of the two fixed alchemical round varieties immediately, quickly enough that the owner can attack with it as part of the same action. Depletion: 1 in 1d10; upon depletion, can still be used as a normal gun of its size.
- **Ring of Seeping Travel:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Pale crystal ring a little too large for any finger it is tried on. Effect (Alien): As the wearer's action, the wearer and their equipment transform into a mass of quivering slime. For one minute the wearer can seep through dirt, earth, stone, structures, and other inert objects, moving up to a long range each turn while in this form. The wearer can't physically affect inert matter and objects, but can make a pseudopod melee attack against creatures that deals a number of points of damage equal to the artifact's level. Alternatively, a bearer not wearing the ring can peer through it to see invisible objects or creatures, as well as out-of-phase objects or creatures. Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, recharged if brought into a proscribed zone).
- **Salubrious Snuffbox:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Small ornate container of powdered tobacco (snuff). Effect: Owner who takes a pinch of snuff regains a number of Pool points of their choice equal to the artifact's level. Depletion: 1 in 1d10.
- **Shadow Duster:** Level 1d6. Form: Coal-black leather duster (long, heavy overcoat). Effect: A shadow duster functions normally as light armor. If a shadow is within immediate range, the wearer can slip from view for up to one minute, becoming as one with the shadow as their action, effectively easing their stealth task to hide by a number of steps equal to the artifact's level. The wearer can stay still and remain essentially invisible as long as they take no action. Alternatively, at any point before one minute elapses, they can step out of any other shadow within long range, even shadows separated by walls or terrain. (The owner gains a sort of sixth sense about other shadows while they're hiding, learning about general shape and placement, but nothing more.) Depletion: 1 in 1d20; upon depletion, can still be worn as a normal duster.
- **Spirit Reflecting Knife:** Level 1d6 + 3. Form: Light blade with hilt (called a "bowie" knife in some settings); potentially self-aware. Effect: This knife is a light melee weapon. Attacks made with it are automatically eased (two steps total). In addition, the user gains two assets for noticing invisible creatures, spirits, and not-currently-manifested ghosts in the area by looking for their reflection in the blade. If spotted, such a creature within immediate range must answer one question put to it by the knife wielder if the creature's level is less than or equal to the knife's and if the knife wielder succeeds on an Intellect attack. Depletion: 1 in 1d20; check each time a spirit is spotted and questioned.
- **Swarm Ring:** Level 1d6. Form: Ring made of dark crystal with strange etchings (of what might be bugs). Effect (Alien): Bearer summons a swarm of tiny bug-like creatures that persist for one minute. The swarm's level is equal to the artifact's level. The swarm attacks a designated foe within short range and hinders their perception tasks for the duration. The bugs seem like roaches at first glance, but a closer look reveals them to have too many legs, eyes, and mouths—none are exactly like the other, and all make a sort of sickly twittering sound. Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, recharged if brought into a proscribed zone).
- **Tanglefoot Lariat:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Rope glinting with entwined silver threads tied with a lasso at one end. Effect: User's short-range lasso attacks made with the lariat are eased. If an attack succeeds, the target is magically restrained, unable to take physical actions until they can escape (PCs make a Might-based roll as their action; NPCs whose level is higher than the artifact's can use their full turn to escape), the user lets them go, or midnight comes. Alternatively, the lassoer can instead choose to make an eased attack with the intention of just snaring a target's arm or leg, hindering the target's physical tasks and preventing them from moving more than an immediate distance on their turn until they use their full action to remove the rope (or the lassoer drops their end). *Tesla Lasso Variant:* This electrified variety is especially effective against demons. All tasks related to restraining demons (whether immaterial or wearing stolen flesh) with the lariat are eased by two steps; treat the lariat as two levels higher for purposes of demons attempting to escape. Depletion: 1 in 1d10.
- **Tracker's Map:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Basic but accurate map of the region where the map is activated. Effect: Unfolding the map allows its bearer to locate a creature whose level is less than the artifact's, no matter where the creature is. The bearer must know or have met the target, know the target's full name (or "true" name), or have an article of clothing or other personal belonging of the target's. If they do, the target's location is pinpointed (to within a short area) on the map. The map includes locations near the map bearer as well as locations near the target, though depending on the distance separating the two, it may not be to scale. The map shows the target's location for one day per artifact level, or until a new target is named. Depletion: 1 in 1d20.
- **Vorpal Six-Gun:** Level 1d6 + 1. Form: Dull black pistol with dully glowing red barrel and chamber; potentially self-aware. Effect: This firearm is a medium long-range weapon (though lighter and heavier variants are possible). Attacks made with it are automatically eased and deal an additional 2 points of damage (6 points total). In addition, if a PC rolls a major effect and the target's level is equal to or less than the artifact's, the PC can choose to implode the target's head. For most living creatures that possess only a single head, that's the end. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per head implosion); upon depletion, can still be used as a normal gun.
- **Wheel of Consumption:** Level 1d6 + 2. Form: Crystal hoop about 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter. Effect (Alien): Anything passed through the hoop whose level is less than the artifact's is disintegrated. Living creatures take damage equal to the artifact's level each round they persist in keeping any part of their body within the ambit of the wheel. This item could be used as a weapon, but it's awkward, hindering melee attacks (or a ranged attack) made with it by two steps. On a hit, the hoop deals damage equal to its level. Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, recharged if brought into a proscribed zone).

### Self Aware Artifacts

One method alchemists use to empower an object—usually a firearm—with uncanny abilities is to infuse a spirit that already has access to such abilities. Said spirit could be a ghost of a once-living person, an elemental, a synthesized mind, or perhaps something inscrutable called from antediluvian epochs.

**Item Goals:** Some self-aware artifacts have a goal; others can hardly be bothered to communicate with their bearer. A few options for those with goals include the following:

| D6 | Artifact Goal |
|----|----|
| 1 | Conclude the unfinished business of the ghost infused with the item |
| 2 | If a weapon, defeat a certain class of targets, such as cursed beasts or celebrities |
| 3 | Spread order and rule of law |
| 4 | Spread chaos and anarchy |
| 5 | Befriend/assist bearer |
| 6 | Undermine/gaslight bearer ("cursed") |

**Artifact Communication:** Some self-aware items can speak directly into the minds of their bearers (or potential bearers), but no one else can hear the item. Others can speak audibly, allowing anyone nearby to potentially communicate with the item.

**Artifact Autonomy:** If a self-aware artifact has a goal, then they work to achieve it in some fashion. Potential options include the following:

| d6 | Ability to Act |
|----|----|
| 1 | Convincing/cajoling bearer |
| 2 | Punishing the bearer's inaction by causing minor pain (a couple of points of Speed or Intellect damage) once each day, or each time a perfect opportunity to act is ignored by the bearer |
| 3 | Creating auditory and visual hallucinations designed to lure/trick bearer into a situation where they have few choices other than do as the artifact wishes |
| 4 | Offering a reward; possibly a new artifact function that can only be used in pursuit of the goal, or the location of some great treasure |
| 5 | Acting of its own accord when no one is looking |
| 6 | Taking mental control of the bearer for up to an hour per day on a failed Intellect defense roll; bearer may not remember what they did during the lost hour |

**Artifact Depletion:** Self-aware artifacts don't deplete the same way regular artifacts do; if a depletion is indicated, the entity within the artifact is "on sabbatical" or is otherwise choosing not to communicate. Usually, the artifact will return to normal after a few days, or when the user does something to mollify the entity granting the item self-awareness.

## Currency And Equipment

### Currency

All kinds of currencies could be used simultaneously in your weird west game on account of the scarcity of officially issued coins and paper money.

**Dollars:** In a weird west world inspired by real world history, you might decide to adopt the dollar.

| Category       | Dollar Value     |
|----------------|------------------|
| Inexpensive    | Up to $1         |
| Moderate       | $1–$10           |
| Expensive      | $100-$500        |
| Very expensive | $1,000–$10,000   |
| Exorbitant     | $10,000+         |

**Gold Dust and Nuggets:** Gold could be a highly valued currency in your setting. Pouches or vials of gold dust weighing no more than half an ounce (14 g) are equal to an inexpensive item, bags of gold dust weighing no more than 5 ounces (140 g) are equal to a moderately priced item, and so on.

**Ammunition:** Ammunition is valuable. It could even be one form of trade used in your weird west game.

| Price Category | Rounds of Ammo |
|----------------|----------------|
| Inexpensive    | 1-5 bullets    |
| Moderate       | 100 bullets    |
| Expensive      | 5,000 bullets  |
| Very expensive | 10,000 bullets |
| Exorbitant     | 50,000 bullets |

### Inexpensive Items

| Weapons   | Notes                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Arrows    | About 12 arrows                                     |
| Bullets   | About 5 bullets                                     |
| Knife     | Light weapon; liable to break (depletion: 1 in d10) |
| Horseshoe | Light weapon, short range when thrown               |

| Other Items    | Notes                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Burlap sack    |                                                     |
| Calico fabric  | A few yards of fabric useful for repairing clothing |
| Candle         |                                                     |
| Cast-iron skillet | Ideal for cooking food over a campfire           |
| Deck of cards  | 52-card deck made of simple cardstock               |
| Jerky          | Enough to feed a person for one day                 |
| Kerosene, 1 pint |                                                   |
