# Cyberpunk

This section contains optional rules, character options, cyphers, artifacts, and equipment specifically tailored for Cyberpunk settings.

## Cyberpunk Optional Rules

> [!NOTE]
> **Cyberpunk Settings**
> Cyberpunk settings are characterized by high tech and low life. Megacorporations rule the world, cybernetics are commonplace, and the line between man and machine is blurred.

### Artificial Intelligence

In a cyberpunk setting, artificial intelligence (AI) is often a key theme.

*   **Weak AI:** Specialized software carrying out specific tasks (autopiloting a car, playing chess, managing a weapon). It simulates intelligence but isn't self-aware.
*   **Sim (Simulated Intelligence):** Advanced AI with a personality interface, capable of passing a Turing test in its area of expertise. It might seem like a person, but it has no true consciousness.
*   **Strong AI:** True machine consciousness. Capable of learning, creativity, and independent thought. Often indistinguishable from a human mind, though perhaps faster or stranger.
*   **Post-Singularity AI:** A god-like machine intelligence with capabilities far beyond human comprehension.

### Brainslides

Digital recordings of a person’s experiences, using data from their optics and other senses, that play directly into your senses. For example, you can experience what it’s like to be a professional baseball player hitting a grand slam, a popular musician performing at a sold-out venue, or a tourist-astronaut jumping around on the moon.

When “viewing” a brainslide, you experience the events of the recording as if you were the person being recorded. Typical family-friendly brainslides are vacation sites (beaches, hiking trails, zoos), sports events, and theater performances. Typical adult-oriented brainslides are extreme sports (parachuting, parkour, whitewater rafting, and so on), voyeurism, and sexual acts. Selling brainslides of illegal activities (such as murder or torture, whether the recorded person is the perpetrator or victim) is illegal, but they can be found on the black market at inflated prices.

There is some concern among medical professionals that intense brainslides can cause lasting brain and nerve damage, similar to heavy drinking or drug use. There is some evidence that experiencing violent brainslides desensitizes the user to violence.

### Engrams

An engram is a digital copy of a human consciousness. It might be a backup of a living person, a "ghost" of a dead one, or an entirely constructed personality.

*   **D-Engram:** A low-fidelity copy, barely more than a Sim. useful for customer service bots or basic NPCs.
*   **C-Engram:** A decent copy, but noticeably artificial. Good for temporary assistants.
*   **B-Engram:** A high-quality copy, capable of fooling most people for a short time.
*   **A-Engram:** A perfect digital replica. Indistinguishable from the original consciousness.

### Netrunning

Netrunning is the act of interacting with cyberspace using a direct neural interface (usually a datajack or wireless implant).

#### Jacking In

To netrun, a character must "jack in" to a computer, terminal, or network. This places their consciousness into the digital realm.

#### PC Avatars

In cyberspace, a netrunner appears as an **Avatar**. This digital self can look like anything the user wants—a knight in armor, a chrome demon, a ball of light, or a realistic copy of their physical body.

#### Interacting with Cyberspace

Mental actions become physical in cyberspace. "Attacking" a firewall might look like slashing it with a sword or shooting it with a laser.

*   **Speed:** In cyberspace, Speed determines your processing power and reaction time.
*   **Intellect:** Intellect determines your software strength and ability to manipulate code.
*   **Might:** Might is largely irrelevant, replaced by the integrity of your connection and hardware.

#### Cyberspace Directory

Networks are often visualized as "Nodes" or "Fortresses".
*   **Public Nodes:** Libraries, shops, open forums.
*   **Private Nodes:** Corporate servers, personal banks, secure data vaults. Require hacking to enter.

#### Glitches

When things go wrong in cyberspace, it can hurt. ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) attacks the netrunner's mind directly.

#### Ejection Glitches

Being forcibly disconnected (e.g., if your physical body is unplugged or you hit "Black ICE") causes "Dump Shock"—disorientation, nausea, and potential damage (Intellect or Speed points).

### Corporate Currency

In many cyberpunk settings, national currencies have been replaced or supplemented by corporate scrip. A "Eurobuck" or "Credit" is the standard, but various corps might issue their own.

### Drugs

Drugs are a common part of cyberpunk life, used for recreation, combat enhancement, or coping with the dystopia.

#### Activation

Most drugs take effect immediately (injected/inhaled) or within minutes (ingested).

#### Overdose

Taking too much of a drug, or mixing incompatible drugs, can lead to an Overdose. This usually moves the character down the damage track or inflicts direct damage.

#### Addiction

Using addictive substances requires a Might save to avoid addiction. The difficulty increases with frequent use.

#### Tolerance

Long-term use builds tolerance, requiring higher doses for the same effect, increasing the risk of overdose.

#### Recovery

Breaking an addiction is a long-term task, often requiring therapy, medical help (see "Therapeutic Drugs"), or cold turkey (which hinders all tasks).

#### Common Drugs

*   **Axodrine®:** Motion sickness and balance.
*   **Blue Spirit:** Strength booster, lowers inhibitions.
*   **Calcichloride®:** Pain relief and healing.
*   **Clickbait:** Social lubricant.
*   **Crunch:** Stimulant.
*   **Dex®:** Combat stimulant (Speed/Reflexes).
*   **Elevate®:** Focus and energy.
*   **Last Gasp®:** Temporary invincibility/ignore pain.
*   **Liftoff®:** Anti-dependency aid.
*   **Moon Rocks:** Powerful sedative/sleep aid.
*   **Pixel®:** Netrunning trance aid.
*   **Rampage:** Massive strength boost.

### Inflation

Prices in cyberpunk settings are often volatile.

### Planned Obsolescence

Tech items (phones, guns, cyberware) are designed to break or become outdated.
*   **GM Intrusion:** An item fails or requires a paid update at a critical moment.

## Cyberpunk Character Options

In a cyberpunk game, you can use the standard warrior, explorer, speaker, and adept types. However, you might find that the flavors of those types don't quite fit the chrome-and-neon vibe. The following optional types are renamed and tweaked versions of the standard generic types, adjusted to better fit the genre.
