### Optional Modern Fantasy Rules

#### Cantrips

Cantrips are simple, low-powered spells that almost anyone can learn. In a modern fantasy setting, cantrips can be as ubiquitous and unremarkable as twenty-first-century technology. Instead of using the flashlight function of a smartphone, use a light cantrip. Instead of running a dishwasher or vacuum cleaner, use a cleaning cantrip. Instead of using a megaphone, use a voice‑amplifying cantrip.

Cantrips are generally not powerful enough to directly affect an unwilling creature or damage an unattended object. In the rare case that using a cantrip might cause actual harm, change, or damage, the attack roll for the cantrip is hindered by two steps (unless otherwise noted).

Any PC can learn two cantrips by spending 2 XP. How they learn them depends on the setting—they might need to study with a mentor, take a specific college class, pay for an informative ritual, study a magical book, invent it on their own, unlock some previously unrealized potential within themselves, and so on. Learning cantrips does not count toward character advancement. There is no limit to how many cantrips a PC can learn. In all other respects, cantrips work just like other character abilities.

Unless the theme of the setting is that everyone is quite proficient in magic, it’s probably best to limit an individual NPC to knowing just a couple of cantrips, with many people not knowing any at all. A reasonable guideline is that an NPC can know a number of cantrips equal to their level.

The following are examples of typical cantrips in a modern fantasy setting

**Bee Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You summon a nearby level 0 bee, housefly, gnat, or similar flying pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins flying around, possibly landing on a creature. The cantrip doesn’t work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action.

A level 0 creature isn’t a threat to a character and is instantly killed if hit. However, tiny creatures like the ones described in the Bee and Bug cantrips usually have a level 2 modifier for Speed defense because of their size.

**Bug Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You summon a nearby level 0 spider, cockroach, silverfish, or similar crawling pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins moving around, possibly crawling on a creature. The cantrip doesn’t work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action.

**Candles Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create up to four candle-like lights that move to your mental commands (but no farther away than how far you can reach), lasting about ten minutes. Each light can be a different color. Action.

**Chill Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You lower the temperature of a target within short range. If the target is a creature, for the next couple of rounds they feel like they’re standing under an air conditioning vent. If the target is an object no larger than a 1-foot (30 cm) cube, you cool it down as if you’d dunked it into a bucket of ice. Action.

**Clean Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You remove dirt, mud, and similar substances from one set of clothing (such as the clothes you’re wearing), about 1 cubic foot of loose material (clothes, curtains, a box of toys, and so on), or an immediate area on a surface (such as a wall or floor). When used on clothing, this also does a decent job of removing wrinkles. Action.

**Color Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the color of an object, or you brighten or dull its color. The object can be up to about 1 cubic foot in size and up to a short distance away. If used to change a creature’s hair color, it lasts a few days. Action.

**Convenient Rideshare Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** When using a rideshare or taxi app, you are connected with a driver who can pick you up within a couple of minutes. If you use this cantrip in a remote area where drivers are scarce, results can get strange; for example, the car and driver might be ghosts, you might have to share your ride with a dangerous supernatural creature, or you might arrive at your destination minutes before or hours after you were picked up. Action.

**Cooking Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You accelerate the preparation and cooking of one dish, reducing the time until it’s ready by about ten minutes. (Time-consuming cooking, such as a large turkey, requires multiple castings.) Under normal circumstances, this doesn’t burn, overcook, or otherwise ruin the dish. Action.

**Cut Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You cut an object up to level 2 as if using a sharp knife or a pair of scissors, up to an immediate distance away. For example, this works on rope, candles, food, cloth, paper, or even a thin wire or thin chain necklace. The object usually gives off harmless blue sparks when it’s cut. Action.

**Darkness Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You suppress light in a cubic or spherical area about 1 foot (30 cm) across within an immediate distance. Outdoors or in bright light, this area becomes very dim; otherwise, it becomes darkness. When you create this area, decide if it remains at a specific location (such as on a desk) or if it is attached to some part of you (such as your head or left hand) and moves with you. The cantrip ends after about a minute. Action.

**Erase Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You erase up to a page of text from a typical surface (such as paper, parchment, wood, or plastic) within immediate range. The writing slowly disappears over a few seconds. Affecting magical writing requires an Intellect-based attack roll. Action.

{{< hint info >}}
Erase Cantrip doesn’t remove fingerprints, impressions in the paper, or other evidence that writing used to be there.
{{< /hint >}}

**Exterminate Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a bolt of energy that kills one common vermin creature (level 0) within a short distance, such as a fly, worm, cockroach, or mouse. One casting can affect multiple smaller creatures (such as ants or fleas) within 1 cubic foot. The spell is accompanied by a quick bolt of black and yellow energy. Action

{{< hint info >}}
Exterminate Cantrip is an exception to the rule that trying to cause direct harm with a cantrip is hindered by two steps. A swarm whose level is 1 or higher is unaffected by this cantrip, even though the individual creatures in the swarm might be.
{{< /hint >}}

**Extra Chair Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** A table you touch somehow has room (and a chair) for one more person to comfortably sit there without affecting anyone else at the table. This lasts anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, or less if the person in the extra chair leaves for more than a few minutes. Action.

**Extra Fries Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You update a recent fast food or delivery order so that when it arrives, it includes an additional order of French fries or other side available from the restaurant (tater tots, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and so on). Sometimes this happens for free, and sometimes you have to pay an additional charge. Remember to tip your server. Action.

**Fire Crown Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a crown-like manifestation of fire on your head that lasts for ten minutes. The fire doesn’t burn you. If anyone touches it or makes a melee attack aimed at your head, you can make a free Intellect-based attack roll against them to inflict 1 point of damage. Action.

Variants of Fire Crown Cantrip create a crown of lightning, smoke, ice, water, or thorns.

**Firework Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create an illusory firework within short range, which bursts with sparkling lights and a loud pop. The effect is obviously an illusion but might distract or startle people who aren’t expecting it. Action.

**Flavor Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You touch one plate or bowl of food or one large glass or mug of liquid, improving its flavor. This doesn’t affect the nutritional value or texture, nor does it fix spoiled food; it just makes it taste more to your preference (so you could eat spoiled meat or moldy vegetables and they’d taste fine). You decide the sort of flavor change—more or less spicy, salty, savory, sweet, and so on, in any combination appropriate for food or drink. Action.

**Forbidden Topic Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** Wards an immediate area (enough to cover a large table at a holiday family gathering) against conversation about a topic of your choice, such as “the election,” “Mommy’s trial,” or “that Cordell kid.” Anytime someone in the area attempts to talk about this topic, make an Intellect-based roll against them; success means they either talk about something else or remain silent. The cantrip lasts for ten minutes or until you fail an Intellect-based roll to stop someone from talking about that topic. Action.

**Gather Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You gather a scattered bunch of items into a small space, as if you had spent a minute sweeping them together with your hands or a broom. This affects about 1 square yard (1 sq m), up to an immediate distance away. The cantrip is mainly useful for collecting things that have been spilled, or for making it easier to clean up a room. Action.

**Ghostly Wings Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You sprout a pair of ghostly wings that immediately unfurl, then vanish a few seconds later. If you cast this cantrip while falling, you reduce the damage from the fall by 1 point. Enabler.

**Green Light Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You tweak the traffic lights at an intersection within long range so that one of them turns green within a few seconds. The other lights in that system automatically adjust to compensate (turning yellow and then red for cross traffic). Depending on that traffic system, the light remains green anywhere from about ten seconds to a minute. Enabler.

**Hand Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You levitate or manipulate an object of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or less at up to a short distance. The effect is not particularly strong—about the same strength as trying to push, pull, or twist something just using the strength of your hand (without your arm). Action.

**Hide Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You conceal one target within immediate range for about a minute. The target can be no larger than a typical rabbit, or several objects no larger than dice. The target is basically invisible to anyone in front of you, but the illusion doesn’t work on anyone to your side or behind you. (If someone is intent on seeing the invisible target, make an Intellect-based attack roll against them to hide it from their view.) Action.

**Light Switch Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You toggle up to four light controls (such as a wall switch or a lamp’s button, knob, or pull cord) within short range. You must be able to see these light controls or have a clear idea of where they are (such as turning on your front porch light and living room floor lamp from outside your home). You can toggle these switches on or off in any combination. Action.

**Loudness Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You amplify your voice, allowing you to speak at up to three times your normal volume. This isn’t enough to harm anyone, but you can speak comfortably to a large crowd or across a very long distance without effort. Action.

**Mask Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a costume mask on the face of a creature you touch. The mask can be simple (like a domino mask), fancy (like a masquerade ball mask), or deceptive (like a Halloween costume mask of a monster or specific person). The mask is obviously just a mask, not a disguise, but a deceptive mask viewed from at least a short distance away might fool someone into thinking it’s a real face, providing an asset to disguise tasks at this range. The mask lasts for about a minute. If removed, the mask immediately disappears. Action.

**Mending Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You touch a broken object of up to level 3 and attempt to magically repair a single break or tear in it, such as a cracked stone wall, a shattered hand mirror, or a torn piece of clothing. The damage can be no larger than about what you can cover with both of your open hands. If you succeed at an Intellect-based roll against the object’s level, you repair it (although it still shows signs of being previously broken, and may be fragile there). You can use this ability multiple times on the same object to repair larger breaks. Action.

**Message Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You whisper a short message (about five to ten seconds) to a creature you can see within a long distance. The target hears it as if you had whispered it in their ear. Action.

**Mystic Eyes Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the appearance of your eyes. If you just change their color to a different hue (such as to blue, green, or brown), the change lasts for an hour. If you change them to something unusual, such as red, yellow, solid black, or glowing, it only lasts for a minute. Action.

**Obedient Flames Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You affect flames within a short distance, making them appear brighter or dimmer, flicker strangely, or change color. This lasts for one minute. You can affect up to several dozen candles, a few torches, or one typical campfire with each casting of the cantrip. Action.

**Open and Close Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You open or close a small object within short range, such as a bag, box, bottle, footlocker, window, or lightweight door. This cantrip cannot lock or unlock locks. Action.

**Pen Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You write with your finger on a surface for up to ten minutes as if using a common ballpoint pen. The “ink” immediately dries once you write, but it can be smeared or cleaned up like a normal pen. The ink is blue, black, or dark brown, decided when you cast this cantrip. Action.

**Present Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You teleport an object within an immediate distance into your upturned hand. The item has to be something you’re carrying (such as a gem in your pouch or a dagger in your boot), something you can see (such as a coffee cup or mobile phone on the other side of the table), or something you know is within range (such as a note you saw someone put in their pocket). The cantrip affects one small object (for example, a cup or mobile phone) or up to a dozen smaller items from the same location (perhaps coins or dice). Action.

**Quiet Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You muffle the noise from one target within a short distance for a few seconds. Breaking a window or knocking a glass off the table would be no louder than someone tapping their finger on the glass. An obnoxious security alarm would only be as loud as a computer speaker. A ringing phone would be barely audible. If you cast this on a willing creature, they gain an asset on stealth tasks for one round if they move no more than an immediate distance on their turn. Action.

{{< hint info >}}
Affecting an unwilling creature (or something they’re carrying) with an ability requires an attack roll to succeed. If you’re using a cantrip, by default that attack roll is hindered by two steps
{{< /hint >}}

**Rainbow Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a softly glowing band of colors resembling a rainbow, extending from your hand to an object or willing creature within short range. The far end doesn’t move (a creature could move away from it by going around a corner or out of range). You can anchor your end in place or allow it to move when your hand moves. The rainbow gives off light like a candle and lasts about a minute. Action.

**Reshape Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the shape of a metal, glass, or stone object you touch into a different shape. For example, you could turn a coin into a ring, a cup into a plate, or a piece of glass into something resembling a gemstone. This normally lasts about a minute, but the object tends to revert early if anyone else touches or examines it too closely. Action.

**Smoke Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a harmless puff of smoke within an immediate distance. The smoke fills about a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and dissipates over the next few rounds. You decide if the smoke is white, grey, blue, brown, green, red, or yellow. Action.

**Sprout Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You make seeds sprout at an accelerated rate, causing a week’s worth of growth to happen in just a few moments. The seeds must be within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and no more than an immediate distance from you. If the seeds are in viable soil, they take root as if planted there. If cast on immature or closed flowers, they bloom. If cast on a piece of unripe fruit, it immediately ripens. Action.

**Stitch Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You sew two touched pieces of cloth or thin leather together, up to about 2 square yards (1.5 sq m). The stitches are of the same quality of hand stitching by a tailor or leatherworker of reasonable skill. You choose the path of the stitches, so you could create a piece of clothing by casting this cantrip several times. Instead of sewing together two items, you can unravel the stitches of a touched object, affecting up to 2 square yards (1.5 sq m). Action.

**Tattoo Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create an image on your skin, as if tattooed there by a reasonably talented artist. The image can be no larger than your hand, and consists of just one color. You can cast this cantrip multiple times to create a larger tattoo, use more colors, or both. The image lasts about an hour. Action.

**Throwing Stone Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You summon a nearby object of stone, brick, concrete, cement, asphalt, or a similar hard and common mineral to your hand. The cantrip doesn’t work if there are no suitable loose materials within a short distance. Action.

**Tie Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You control a piece of string, rope, or twine within short range, causing it to tie itself to another object within 1 foot (30 cm) of it, using any sort of simple, common knot (such as a square knot). Instead of tying a knot, you can cast this cantrip on a simple knot within short range, untying it. Action.

**Tiny Illusion Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a single image of a creature or object within immediate range. The image must fit within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a mouse jump or crawl around), but it can’t leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound (up to the volume of a person’s normal speaking voice) but not smell. It lasts for one minute, but if you want to change the original illusion significantly—such as making a creature appear to be wounded— you must concentrate on it again (though doing so doesn’t cost additional Intellect points). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create; action to modify.

**Tremor Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You make the ground or floor vibrate within a short area, feeling similar to a mild earthquake. Other objects on the floor might vibrate or slide (no more than a hand’s span) because of this vibration. Action.

**Warm Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You raise the temperature in a very small area (about 1 cubic foot) within short range, enough to make someone’s face feel flushed or warm a drink to about the temperature of freshly served coffee. Action.

**Wash Car Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You clean the outside of a typical passenger automobile within immediate range as if it had gone through an automatic car wash. Very large or very dirty cars may require multiple castings. The cantrip works on motorcycles, bicycles, and other small vehicles as well. Action.

**Wet or Dry Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You alter the moisture level of an object or area within immediate range, affecting about a 1-foot (30 cm) cube or one set of clothing. If you want the target to be wetter, it is dampened as if you poured a cup of water on it. If you want it drier, it is dried as if you hung it out in the sun on a warm day. Action.

**Wireless Network Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You improve wireless network reception in an immediate area for ten minutes. This improves poor or average reception to full strength and zero bars to at least one bar. When you cast this cantrip, you decide if this improved reception affects everyone in the area or just you. Action.

**Wrap Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You use available materials to wrap up an object within an immediate distance. The wrapped object must fit within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube. For example, you could wrap a gift box with decorative paper, wrap a piece of paper around a letter to create an envelope, or wrap a pile of potatoes with burlap to create an easily carried bundle. Action.

**Youth Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the appearance of your face so you look about ten years younger than your normal appearance, lasting about an hour. Action.

##### Optional Rules: Learning Cantrips

In some fantasy settings, cantrips are commonly available, but not everyone knows how to cast them (in the same way that phone and computer apps are common, but not everyone knows how to code an app). When someone tries to learn a cantrip, have them attempt a level 3 Intellect-based task (skills such as magical lore affect this). If they succeed, they learn the cantrip. If they fail, they don’t. A PC only spends the 2 XP to learn cantrips when they succeed at this roll. This way, learning a cantrip isn’t automatic—it’s more like passing a final exam. And there are ways for the character to “cram” for this test, including expending Effort, getting help, or using an appropriate asset.

## Covens

Magic is a community affair, and magicians are more powerful in groups. A coven is a group of three or more magicians with similar goals and values, supporting each other and working together to hone their craft. Forming or joining a coven grants characters additional abilities, which you gain separately from the standard advancement track. When you join a coven, you start at rank 1 within that coven, and over time can advance to rank 6. Rank is a measurement of your connection to the coven, and doesn’t necessarily correspond to your character tier—for example, a high-tier character might have a low rank in their coven. However, your coven rank cannot exceed your character tier. The primary magical benefit of joining a coven is gaining access to its spells: a set of character abilities that all members (of the required rank) can use. These spells are usually tailored to the coven’s interests and purpose, and are sorted by rank from 1 to 6. Because a character’s rank within a coven starts at 1 when they join, a new member of a coven has access to the coven’s rank 1 spell. When the character advances to rank 2, they immediately gain access to the coven’s rank 2 spell, and so on. You can think of covens as similar to flavors, in that they allow the GM and players to modify characters with abilities. Unlike choosing an ability from a flavor, a character doesn’t have to trade away or swap anything to choose or use a coven spell—they have access to these spells automatically according to their rank in the coven. For example, if the rank 1 spell for the Benevolent Bakers uses the Resist the Elements ability (handy for working over a hot stove all day), any character who joins the Benevolent Bakers automatically gains Resist the Elements, without having to spend extra XP to learn it or trade away a type ability for it. It’s possible for a character to belong to multiple covens, as long as the covens don’t have opposed goals. Characters advance their rank in each coven separately, so a particular character might be rank 1 in the Chronographers and rank 3 in the Foretellers. If a character leaves or is removed from their coven, they immediately lose access to all of that coven’s spells.

For magician NPCs in a coven, the GM can assume that their rank is equal to their NPC level (with a maximum of 6).

{{< hint info >}}
Spending XP to advance a character’s rank in a coven does not count as one of the four character advancements needed to reach a higher tier
{{< /hint >}}

### Joining A Coven

Joining an existing coven at rank 1 requires a vow and a ritual. Characters must commit to pursuing the coven’s goals and living in accordance with its values. The ritual is a demonstration of dedication to the coven’s purpose, and varies in difficulty accordingly. Characters receive their talisman once the ritual is complete.

### Coven Talismans

A coven talisman is a small item, such as a pendant or ring, that represents a character’s affiliation with the coven. Every coven member may carry a slightly different talisman, but they should be clearly related. The Benevolent Bakers’ talismans might include a necklace, a pin, and a keychain, all with the same whisk design.

Coven talismans are a type of artifact, with a level equal to the character’s rank within the coven and a depletion of “—.” The talisman is what allows the character to use their coven abilities; if the talisman isn’t on the character’s person or within short range, all of the character’s coven magic is hindered by two steps. When a person advances within the coven, the talisman’s appearance may change to reflect this. While these talismans don’t require a depletion roll with each use, a character’s coven talisman automatically depletes if they break from the coven.

### Advancing Within A Coven

Advancing within a coven is a separate matter from advancing a character. In fact, coven advancement is more similar to a long-term benefit of spending XP. Coven advancement should occur after a character has learned, discovered, or achieved something that aligns with the coven’s mission and values.

To advance within the coven, the player spends 3 XP. Characters may mark the occasion with a celebration or let it pass quietly

### Breaking From A Coven

If a character wishes to leave a coven, they relinquish their coven talisman and lose access to their coven abilities. But a character can also break from their coven by behaving in opposition to its values—such as if a Benevolent Baker were to knowingly poison someone. This causes their coven talisman to become depleted, meaning that they can no longer use their coven abilities.

To restore their place in the coven, a disgraced character must begin by making amends with the other members. They then take their coven talisman to an epicenter and perform a ritual with a difficulty equal to their former coven rank. Upon completing the ritual, they regain that rank within the coven and can access spells accordingly.

### Forming A New Coven

Creating a new coven simply requires a bit of discussion among the GM and players. Begin by deciding on the following:

* What’s the coven called?
* What are one or two goals for the coven’s magic? What do they want to learn how to do? What skill do the players want the coven to be known for?
* What are a few succinct values? What do the players agree are the most important things a magician can be? Competent? Fair? Determined? Kind? Loyal? Wealthy?
* What does the coven talisman look like?
* What does the initiation ritual (which exemplifies the coven’s goals and values) consist of?

### Selecting Coven Abilities

Coven abilities are chosen by the GM and players. To start, they need to decide the rank 1 ability. They can determine the rank 2 ability when at least one character is ready to advance within the coven. In a longer campaign, selecting abilities on an ongoing basis—rather than choosing them all at once—means that the players can choose their next coven ability based on what obstacles they expect their characters to face.

The Cypher System Rulebook divides abilities by both category and power level, which is helpful in narrowing down your options. Choose a low-tier ability for ranks 1 and 2, a mid-tier ability for ranks 3 and 4, and a high-tier ability for ranks 5 and 6.

Because covens form around unifying goals and principles, coven abilities should stack upon each other wherever possible. A coven of entomologists learning to summon and control leaf bugs might progress from Influence Swarm at rank 1 to Control Swarm at rank 2, Call Swarm at rank 3, and so on, eventually reaching Insect Eruption at rank 6. Don’t be afraid to be specific! Joining a coven gives characters the opportunity to become experts in a narrow field.

If a pre-existing ability doesn’t capture what the players and GM are looking for, the GM is always free to create new ones. To return to the example of the Benevolent Bakers, no abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook specifically pertain to making food, but the bakers could modify an ability like Natural Crafter to suit their needs.

## Crafting Magic Items

### Crafting Cyphers

1. Choose Cypher Level. Creating a low-level cypher is easier than creating a high-level one. The character decides what level of cypher to create, which must be in the level range for the cypher as listed in the Cypher System Rulebook. Note that some cyphers have the same effect no matter what level they are, so the character could make crafting easier by creating the lowest-level version of that cypher, but the GM is always able to rule that a particular cypher must be crafted at a certain level or higher for it to work. In particular, a stim is very strong for its level range and should always be treated as a level 6 cypher when crafted by a PC.
2. Determine Ingredients. Crafting a magical cypher requires strange and exotic ingredients with inherent magical properties—gems, ink from weird creatures, mysterious herbs, and so on. The level of the cypher determines how expensive these materials are, according to the following table.
3. Assess Difficulty. The difficulty of a cypher crafting task is always equal to 1 + the level of the cypher. The crafter can reduce the assessed difficulty of the task with skill training (such as being trained or specialized in brewing potions or crafting magic items), assets, special abilities provided by their focus or type, and so on. Using a formula, recipe, or other guideline for a specific cypher counts as an asset for this purpose.

Because this is an activity requiring special knowledge, it is not possible for a character with no skill (or with an inability in this skill) to do this sort of crafting; the character cannot attempt the task at all.

For example, Vanya the alchemist wants to create a level 6 healing potion. A level 6 potion has an assessed difficulty of 7 (1 + the level of the cypher). Vanya is trained in brewing potions, so the assessed difficulty is lowered to 6. If she also uses a potion recipe she found in a book of magic, the assessed difficulty becomes 5.

4. Determine Time to Craft. The amount of time it takes to craft a magical cypher is determined by the assessed difficulty, so decreasing that difficulty not only means the character is more likely to succeed, but also that they have to spend less time on crafting it. For any time in excess of nine hours, the process is assumed to have stages where the character is not actively working on it, just checking on it occasionally to make sure everything is going as planned—allowing the base ingredients of a potion to cook for a few hours, stirring to make sure the ingredients don’t congeal, allowing ink on a scroll to dry, and so on. In other words, the character is able to perform other actions in the vicinity of the crafting (such as studying, resting, eating, and so on), but they couldn’t craft during a business trip or in the middle of a wedding. In our previous potion example, the assessed difficulty is 5, so Vanya’s time to craft is one day.
5. Complete Subtasks. The character must complete multiple subtasks that are steps toward finishing the process—one subtask per level of assessed difficulty. The first subtask’s difficulty is 1, and each successive task’s difficulty increases by 1 until the character reaches the last, hardest task with a difficulty equal to the cypher’s assessed difficulty. Generally, subtask attempts occur at equally divided intervals over the course of the full time required to craft the item. If the character fails on a subtask, the item isn’t ruined. Instead, the character only wasted the time spent on that subtask, and they can spend that much time again and try to succeed at that same subtask. If the crafter fails twice in a row on the same subtask, they can continue crafting, but they lose crafting time, and one of the most expensive ingredients is destroyed (or consumed or ruined) and must be replaced before the crafting can continue.

For example, Vanya’s potion brewing (assessed difficulty of 5) is divided into five subtasks (starting at difficulty 1 and ending at 5). Because the crafting time is one day, each subtask takes about five hours (twenty-four hours in a day divided by five subtasks). If Vanya fails on the difficulty 3 subtask, she’s lost five hours of work but can try again. If she fails a second time, she loses another five hours of work and ruins one of her expensive ingredients, which must be replaced before she can continue. When Vanya succeeds at the last subtask (difficulty 5), the potion is finished. Players might ask if they can apply Effort to each subtask. However, applying Effort is something they do in the moment, not over the course of days or weeks. Generally speaking, Effort cannot be applied to any crafting task or subtask that exceeds one day.

### Magical Crafting Skills

Depending on the setting, a character learning how to craft magic items might become trained or specialized in a general “crafting magic items” skill, or need to have a specific skill for each kind of item they might craft, such as “brewing potions” or “crafting wands.” The GM should decide if characters need a specific skill or if the general skill covers all sorts of crafted magic items.

#### Ingredients

| Cypher Level | Materials Consumed       |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | One inexpensive item     |
| 2            | Two inexpensive items    |
| 3            | One moderate item        |

### Crafting Artifacts

The simple way of handling artifacts in a modern fantasy game is to treat an artifact as gaining a long-term benefit of character advancement. The character and GM agree on the artifact being crafted, the character spends 3 XP, the GM hand-waves the crafting process (or has the player narratively describe it), and the character gains the artifact.

For an item that significantly alters gameplay—such as granting the character vast telepathic powers or giving them the ability to teleport at will—the GM can give the item an assessed difficulty equal to 3 + the artifact level and require the character to follow the steps for crafting a magical cypher. Crafting this kind of artifact takes up to five times as many ingredients and up to twenty times as long as crafting a cypher of the same assessed difficulty.

## EXCEEDING CYPHER LIMITS

Sometimes characters might want or need to carry more than their normal allotment of cyphers, and in a modern fantasy game it’s fun to let the overlapping cypher auras (or whatever the cause) create odd side effects. Typically, a side effect stops or reverts if the cypher is activated or leaves the area. If a PC is exceeding their cypher limit, roll 1d00 and consult this table to see what happens (roll anywhere from once per hour to once per day, as fits the story). The table is set up so the first entries are weird but generally harmless, the middle ones are annoying, and the last ones are harmful or dangerous. Optionally, you can increase the threat by adding +20 to the d00 roll for every additional cypher the character is over their limit (+20 for two over, +40 for three over, and so on).

## Familiars

In the most general sense, a familiar is a creature (usually in the form of a small animal) bonded to a magical person as a companion. However, a familiar’s role, intelligence, relationship with their person, powers, and vulnerabilities vary greatly from setting to setting. A familiar might be just a pet or comfort animal, with no special abilities. They might have an empathic or telepathic connection with their person. They might be an extension of the person’s soul, with harm to the familiar causing harm to the person. They might be a fully supernatural creature, able to assist with magical tasks or provide advice. A magical world might only have one of these kinds of familiars, or any of them.

{{< hint danger >}}
CONTENT WARNING: This section talks about the death of pets.
{{< /hint >}}

### Standard Pet

The simplest sort of familiar is one that is a normal animal that has an emotional bond with a character, essentially the same role as a typical pet or comfort animal. The familiar has no special abilities, doesn’t affect the character’s magical abilities in any way, and is not meant to help in combat. Their death doesn’t cause the character physical harm (although it probably causes emotional harm, just like the loss of any pet), and the character can gain a new familiar after a certain amount of time. For this type of familiar, a character should choose the Critter Companion ability, which gives them a level 1 creature.

If the character wants a bigger or tougher creature that is otherwise still a normal animal, they should choose Beast Companion, which gives them a level 2 creature, but otherwise works the same as Critter Companion.

As a slightly more magical variant, choose either of these abilities, but instead of finding a replacement for the creature if it dies, the character can perform a magical ritual (taking 1d6 days) to return them to life.

### Unusual Familiar

There’s no reason a familiar has to resemble a common Earth animal such as a cat, frog, or hawk. If the setting is a world other than Earth, and it has its own animal species that don’t exist on Earth (such as monkey-lizards, capybara-bats, and raven‑snakes), those kinds of creatures are valid choices for a familiar.

If a familiar is a creature whose body is created by the bond with a magician (instead of an existing beast that the character finds and binds with magic), the GM could allow a familiar to look like an extinct animal, such as a dodo bird or Compsognathus dinosaur, or even a permanently miniature version of a large creature such as an elephant or rhinoceros.

History and fantasy literature has suggested other forms for familiars, such as fiendish-looking imps, tiny dragons, alchemy-crafted homunculi, fairies, intelligent floating skulls, and spirits resembling human children. Exactly what sorts of unusual familiars are available in the setting is up to the GM, but their appearance generally doesn’t affect their game statistics. For example, a flying skull familiar and a bat familiar probably have the same level, movement, and modifiers.

### Magical Familiar

This kind of familiar is more of a magical creature than a standard pet. Advantages compared to a standard pet are the familiar’s ability to be physical or intangible, its telepathic connection to the character, and (unlike a standard pet familiar) the fact that it can’t truly die. The disadvantages of this kind of familiar are that they cannot travel too far away from you and they spend most of their time asleep and intangible instead of actively assisting you. For this type of familiar, a character should choose the Bound Magic Familiar ability.

### Soulbound Familiar

This is the most powerful and versatile kind of familiar. They have significant magical abilities, but this requires a bond between the character and familiar that makes them both vulnerable in certain ways.

For this type of familiar, a character should choose the Soul Familiar ability.

### Modifying A Familiar

The following character abilities can be used to improve your familiar or the connection you have with it. (Although most of the ability descriptions refer to the Beast Companion ability, they have the same effect on a familiar as on a beast companion.)

* Tier 3: Stronger Together
* Tier 4: Beast Eyes
* Tier 5: Improved Companion
* Tier 6: As If One Creature

## Reviving Artifacts

While all artifacts have a depletion stat, in some settings artifacts may be “revived” after they deplete. Usually doing this has some kind of high cost, whether that be money, time, work, or the like. Depending on the setting, a character might take an artifact to a well-known repair person who charges a pretty penny for their services, they could make a bargain with a powerful entity who has special magic to bring items back to life, or they might sneak into a corporation to steal a prototype power source to get their artifact back in working condition.

Typically, a revived artifact has the same depletion rate as it did when it was new. However, some repairs or fixes may be less substantial than others. In this case, move the depletion rate down to the next smaller die type. So an artifact that started at 1 in 1d00 would now be 1 in 1d20 (and if repaired again, might be 1 in 1d10). If the artifact’s depletion is already using a d6, double the depletion number (for example, from 1–2 in 1d6 to 1–4 in 1d6). If the depletion number is equal to or higher than the highest number the die can roll (like 1–6 on a d6), change the artifact’s depletion to “automatic.”

## Optional Modern Magic Flavor

## Modern Magic Flavors

### Charms and Figments Flavor

Creating illusions and affecting minds are sometimes considered “soft” magical disciplines (as opposed to “hard” disciplines that manipulate energy or physical matter). It’s common for a character with an interest in one to learn a few spells in the other.

#### Tier 1:

Background Music (1+ Intellect points): You create quiet background music in a short area, loud enough to be heard in a room with normal conversation, but not so loud to be distracting or overwhelming. The music repeats through up to ten songs you know, lasting up to an hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort adds one hour to the play time and five songs to the playlist. Action.

* Fast Talk
* Goad
* Impart Ideal
* Mental Link
* Minor Illusion

#### Tier 2:


* Calm Stranger
* Cloud Personal Memories
* Illusory Duplicate
* Misdirect Blame

#### Tier 3:

* Advanced Command
* Illusory Disguise
* Soothe the Savage

#### Tier 4:

* Calm
* Major Illusion
* Mind Control
* Psychic Burst
* Psychic Suggestion

#### Tier 5:

* Crowd Control
* Mind Games
* Projection

#### Tier 6:

* Flee
* Terrifying Image
* Cozy Magic Flavor

Sometimes a sorcerer isn’t interested in combat magic and secret of the universe. Sometimes “cozy magic” is enough: bonding with a group of close friends, having a nice house, and providing support and comfort in times of need.

### Tier 1:

Advice From A Friend

Check Status (0+ Intellect points): You can telepathically reach out to up to ten creatures known to you, no matter where they are. The individual creatures must be willing and able to communicate. You immediately know their current status—eating, driving, sleeping, angry, injured, fine, great, frightened, worried, and so on, generally in the form of a short sentence or a few words.

These creatures don’t have to share anything they don’t want to, including acknowledging that you checked on them, but they can’t lie through this connection. For example, one person might let you know that they’re upset, but that doesn’t mean you know why (they’re dealing with a recent breakup) or what they’re doing about it (drinking to cope).

You automatically succeed at using this ability; no roll is required. Only you receive the status information. Other people affected by the spell do not get a sense of each other’s statuses, nor do they know who else you’re checking on.

If you spend 5 Intellect points, you can check on twenty creatures at once, and for every 1 Intellect point you spend above that, you can check on an additional ten creatures. Action.

Comfort and Encouragement (2+ Intellect points): You speak to a non-hostile creature within short range, telling them exactly what they need to hear to have a better day. You don’t know what these words are until you say them, but you know they will help the creature’s attitude. If the creature spends a round or two thinking about what you said, they gain an asset on one task of their choosing within one hour. Alternatively, if the creature has an ongoing penalty to tasks (such as having a hangover, sadness from a recent fight with their romantic partner, an injury, or a stressful situation at work), they can ignore that penalty for the next hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more creatures; each level of Effort affects one additional creature. Action to initiate; up to one minute to complete.

Gift of Appeasement (2+ Intellect points): You conjure a trifle that can fit in one hand and will please a creature within immediate range. The object is impractical and inexpensive, but delightful to the creature. Examples include their favorite kind of cookie, a small crafted coffee beverage, or a paper origami of their favorite animal. You don’t know what the spell will create, but you know it will please them if you give it as a gift. If the creature spends one minute appreciating the object (such as eating the cookie, drinking the coffee, or examining the origami), they gain an asset on one task of their choosing within one hour.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more creatures; each level of Effort affects one additional creature. Action per target to initiate.

Tier 2:

Emotional Support Pet (3+ Intellect points): You conjure an adorable animal that most people find irresistibly cute, such as a puppy, kitten, or bunny, who is outgoing and friendly and otherwise acts according to its nature. Anyone in short range who can see the animal eases their defense tasks against negative feelings (such as anger, fear, sadness, and worry) for the next hour. Anyone who pets, cuddles, or plays with this animal for at least a round or two (up to four people can do so at once) feels happier for the next hour and adds +1 to any recovery rolls they make during that time. At the end of the spell, the conjured animal curls up, falls asleep, and disappears in a puff of smoke. If the animal is harmed in any way, anyone who saw it happen eases all rolls against the creature responsible for the harm. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can conjure three additional animals for each level of Effort you apply to this ability. Action.

Adorable Animal: level 1, positive social interactions as level 3

Fetch

Safe Sex (2 Intellect points): One creature you touch can have sexual encounters with no chance of causing pregnancy or transmitting an STI. This protection lasts for ten hours. Action.

Spectral Servant (2 Intellect points): You conjure a spectral servant, a semi-real magical construct that resembles the vague nonthreatening outline of a person. It is more of an extension of your will than a separate being, and it automatically assists you in simple tasks like bringing drinks to houseguests and dealing with chores. It cannot attack or defend, and it vanishes if you are ever more than a short distance from it. The servant lasts for one hour before disappearing. Action.

Telepathic

Tier 3:

Informer

Laundry Day (3+ Intellect points): You select two batches of laundry within immediate range, each large enough for a typical washing machine or dryer. The laundry agitates and spins in midair for a minute, becoming clean and dry as it does so, after which it sorts and stacks itself into neat piles or, if you know where it belongs and that’s within short range, putting itself away. Particularly dirty clothes automatically take a few extra minutes to finish cleaning and drying. The spell doesn’t harm delicate items or clothing that needs special care (such as dry cleaning or low temperature). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more batches of laundry; each level of Effort affects two additional batches. Action to initiate; one minute to complete.

Spring Cleaning (3+ Intellect points): You choose a short area, such as a typical room in a house, two rooms in a small apartment, or two automobiles. Over the next few minutes, the area is thoroughly cleaned—floors are swept, vacuumed, or mopped; surfaces like countertops and sinks are wiped down with a gentle soap and disinfectant; and so on. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the area or clean more quickly; each level of Effort affects an additional short area or reduces the cleaning time from minutes to rounds. Action.

Tier 2:

Diagnose Device (2 Intellect points): You ease by two steps the task to diagnose what’s wrong with a human-made electronic or mechanical device or system (such as a computer, clothes dryer, or toilet) that is damaged, malfunctioning, or broken. You must touch the device to diagnose it. Typically a successful roll means that you learn the main problem and its cause. For example, you could learn that a bricked phone is infected with malware, a pipe is clogged with “flushable” wipes, or a rattling engine needs motor oil. This ability is unreliable at best when used on alien, high-technology, or other mysterious devices. Action.

Mind Reading

Open Mind

Premonition

See History

Tier 3:

Creature Insight

Device Insight

Question Past Self (4+ Intellect points): You reach into the past up to a week and mentally ask your past self one or two questions about something you knew or observed at the chosen time. For example, if you’ve forgotten an important phone number or can’t remember if a particular person was in a meeting, you can ask your past self about it while it’s still fresh in your past self ’s memory. Your past self doesn’t perceive this as an intrusive voice—it just seems like an unexpected moment of reflection about the questions your present self asks. This doesn’t allow you to remember things your past self didn’t actually know at the time, but it can sometimes help your present self (in the form of an asset) learn more about or realize something your past self wasn’t really paying attention to at the time (such as seeing part of a password or noting whether there was a red delivery truck nearby). For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can reach an additional week further into the past. Action.

Modern Magic Flavor

Characters who live in a modern world with magic and technology often know a bit about mixing the two of them together. These characters usually pick up a few useful spells (such as disrupting hostile magic or disabling a mugger’s pistol) from various sources, much like how people tend to learn skills unrelated to their day job (like cooking, dancing, and playing guitar).

Tier 1:

Cantrips (choose any four)

Annoy Electronics (1 Intellect point): You interfere with the operations of an electronic device. The device must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Your interference is limited to things you could do in a few seconds if you were directly using the device. For example, you could make a person’s phone start playing a loud video, type one or two commands on a computer’s keyboard, hit a bunch of buttons in an elevator, or change the station or volume on a television screen. You must succeed at an Intellect-based task against the device or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you have never interacted with the particular device before, the task is hindered by two steps. Action.

Arcanaphone (2 Intellect points): You make use of your cellular service to start a telephone call or use text messaging, lasting up to ten minutes. To anyone watching you, you look like you’re in “hands free” mode. In all respects, this works as if you were carrying your device with you and using it directly (meaning the network notes your current location as if you were carrying your phone, and you may not have coverage in some areas). The first time you use this ability with your mobile service, you must contact their customer service department to authorize the magic (taking ten to sixty minutes), as if it were a new device. You can’t use this ability if you don’t have a cellular account. Action to initiate.

In modern fantasy settings where most people don’t know about magic, connecting your spell to your cellular service probably requires a lot of strange answers and lies about the “device” you’re trying to add to your account.

Enhance Athletics (2 Intellect points): You enhance the ability of one creature to perform certain athletic sports tasks. The creature must be within long range and visible to you. For the next minute, the creature can apply one free level of Effort to any one task to catch, hit, kick, or throw an object, or to any one climbing, jumping, or running task. Once this free level of Effort is used, the magic ends. Action.

Mage Clock: You can mentally connect to a universal magical clock, allowing you to know the local time, down to a tenth of a second. You can have up to three magical timers at once, each of which sounds a mental alarm after an amount of time you specify or at a specific time (such as nine minutes from now, three hours from now, or 8 o’clock in the morning). Action.

Spellpay (1 Intellect point): You initiate a transaction with another person or business cashier within short range, giving them an amount of money that you specify. The currency comes from cash in your possession, money in your account, or a mix of both; the recipient receives this money in the same form as it came from you. For example, if you send someone $150, $50 of which is cash in your wallet and $100 of which comes from your bank account, they suddenly have $50 cash on hand and $100 in their bank account. Instead of a transaction between two people, you can instead use this ability to access your account, withdrawing or depositing cash as if using a teller machine. Action.

Spellpay can access any monetary account you use, such as a checking or savings account through a bank or credit union, or a mobile payment service such as Apple Pay, PayPal, or Venmo

Ward

Tier 2:

Charm Machine

Dispel Magic (2+ Intellect points): Choose one magical effect within long range. An effect of up to level 3 ends if you succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the level of the effect, or against the level of the creature or object the magical effect affects, whichever is higher. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can apply Effort to increase the level of the effect that can potentially be dispelled. Action.

Gun Jammer (2+ Intellect points): You can interfere with a firearm so the next time it is used, it jams or misfires. The weapon must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Make an Intellect-based attack against the weapon or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you succeed, the next attack with the firearm fails, and the weapon won’t fire until someone uses an action to correct the problem. If you activate this ability when it isn’t your turn, your attack against the weapon is hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more firearms; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action or enabler.

Magical Power Current (2+ Intellect points): You provide electricity to a device that runs on standard house current, such as a laptop computer, circular saw, or microwave oven, allowing it to function as if plugged in for one hour. The cost is 2 Intellect points plus 1 point per level of the device. Action.

Safe Fall

Safe Sex (2 Intellect points): One creature you touch can have sexual encounters with no chance of causing pregnancy or transmitting an STI. This protection lasts for ten hours. Action.

Third Eye

Tier 3:

Diagnose Device (2 Intellect points): You ease by two steps the task to diagnose what’s wrong with a human-made electronic or mechanical device or system (such as a computer, clothes dryer, or toilet) that is damaged, malfunctioning, or broken. You must touch the device to diagnose it. Typically a successful roll means that you learn the main problem and its cause. For example, you could learn that a bricked phone is infected with malware, a pipe is clogged with “flushable” wipes, or a rattling engine needs motor oil. This ability is unreliable at best when used on alien, high-technology, or other mysterious devices. Action.

Network Tap

Sensor

Tier 4:

Repair Machine (3+ Intellect points): You automatically repair one broken device of up to level 4 that you touch, restoring it to full working condition. This ability works only if at least 80 percent of the original device is still on hand. The device may still need fuel, oil, or other substances that aid its operation but are not part of the electronics or mechanism. This ability only reliably works on human-crafted devices and tends to fail when used on alien, high-technology, or otherwise mysterious machines. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the target level that can be affected by 1. Action.

## Optional Rules For The Apocalypse

The optional rules presented in this chapter accommodate a variety of circumstances that PCs could face after civilization falls. Some represent useful information that rarely comes up in other games but is ever‑present in almost every post‑apocalyptic game, such as scavenging and how to repair before‑times machines, the game effects of exposure and starvation, and so on.

Other optional rules support play in the aftermath of a particular type of cataclysm or style of play. If nuclear war destroyed the world, the landscape is likely much different than if a pandemic wiped out most people.

And that’s to say nothing of more fantastic elements that can pop up in a post‑apocalyptic setting, such as the civilization‑shattering aftereffects of the Christian Judgment Day, kaiju, time storms, and so on.

Most of the rules are meant for the GM’s eyes only—things that happen behind the scenes or that are secrets the PCs might find out over the course of the game.

Realistic Versus Fantastic Optional Rules: Some of the optional rules presented here are for realistic or plausible scenarios like nuclear war or climate change, and some are for fantastic events and settings such as time storms, the return of magic, or incredible mutations. Realistic optional rules usually also apply in games that use one or more fantastic optional rules. Ultimately, it’s your choice. Feel free to use some, all, or none of these optional rules when running your game, or introduce others of your own devising (or from another genre sourcebook) to provide a unique twist to the game.

### Exposure, Starvation, And Dehydration

Codifying the effects of exposure, starvation, and dehydration for a tabletop RPG probably makes sense only in a post‑apocalyptic scenario, given that survival is a primary theme of the genre.

When to Use: If PCs are exposed to the elements, don’t have enough food, and/or don’t have enough water, their health and life span are directly affected.

Effect: As noted under Too Cold, Too Hot, Starvation, and Dehydration hereafter.

#### Exposure

The human body can withstand temperatures that are too cold for it or too hot for it for a brief period before degrading.

Too Cold

Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 60° F (16° C) eventually uses up a body’s stored energy. The result is hypothermia, when the body loses heat faster than it can produce it. A body temperature that’s too low affects the brain, making the target unable to think clearly or move well. Those with adequate clothing and/or shelter appropriate to the environment are protected. Generally, a PC can survive extreme cold for about twenty minutes to about two hours.

In game terms, unprotected characters, or even characters who have less than adequate protection, suffer 1 point of ambient damage per hour in temperatures near or below 32° F (0° C), or 1 point of ambient damage per round in subzero (–18° C) conditions. In addition, PCs in subzero temperatures with inadequate protection must succeed on a difficulty 4 Might defense roll each hour or descend one step on the damage track.

Too Hot

Prolonged exposure to a wet‑bulb temperature of 95° F (35° C) is the upper limit of safety, beyond which the human body can’t cool itself by evaporating sweat. Heat exhaustion is the result, leading to weakness, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Heat exhaustion can progress to heatstroke, when the body’s temperature regulation system fails. Those with adequate shelter or some sort of cooling system are protected. Generally, a PC can survive extreme heat for about twenty minutes to two or three hours.

In game terms, PCs in too‑hot conditions suffer 1 point of ambient damage per ten minutes. In addition, a character exposed to extreme heat must make a level 4 Might defense roll (hindered if the character is also dehydrated) every ten minutes. On a failed roll, the character descends one step on the damage track.

##### Rule Of Three

One popular mnemonic for knowing how long a person can survive in extreme circumstances is the Rule of Three. It goes something like this: You can survive for three minutes without oxygen, you can survive for three days without water, and you can survive for three weeks without food. However, the rule depends on a person not being directly exposed to the environment and not being under physical duress, and requires someone who can hold their breath for three minutes, which is not most people. Usually, in a post‑apocalyptic RPG scenario, PCs won’t have such luxuries.

#### Starvation

Generally, a PC can survive without food for about ten days to several weeks. In game terms, PCs who go without food take 3 points of ambient damage each day. On any day a PC has taken starvation damage, their tasks are hindered (even if the character makes a recovery roll to regain lost Pool points). In addition, after seven days without food, a starving character must make a level 5 Might defense roll each day that follows. On a failed roll, the character descends one step on the damage track.

#### Dehydration

Generally, a PC can survive without water for three to five days, but this time frame can be shorter in extreme heat or physical activity. In game terms, PCs who go without water take 3 points of ambient damage every twelve hours. On any day a PC has taken dehydration damage, their tasks are hindered (even if the character makes a recovery roll to regain lost Pool points). In addition, after one day without water, a dehydrated character must succeed on a level 5 Might defense roll each day. On a failed roll, the character descends one step on the damage track.

### Radiation In The Real World

Exposure to dangerous amounts of radiation can cause severe damage to the human body, including cellular mutations, cancer, and death.

When to Use: If nuclear war led to the apocalypse, regions of dangerous radiation linger in the aftermath. Even if you predicate that civilization fell for some other reason, radiation could still be a hazard: a few nuclear bombs may have since been launched by a doom‑driven survivor group that found an old silo, a before‑times nuclear power plant went critical and PCs must access it, alien invaders used weapons that left behind radioactive scars, or just because.

Use this optional rule to evoke a more realistic approach to dangerous radiation. You could also use it in a setting with fantastic elements as a baseline effect, even if for some, exposure also leads to the potential for incredible mutations.

Effect: Methods to detect and mitigate radiation are useful to avoid stumbling into it in the first place, as described in the next section. Dangerous radiation harms and eventually kills people and other creatures, as described under the sections that follow.

Telltale Signs of Dangerous Radiation

Confirming the Presence of Radiation: If PCs have a functioning radiation‑detecting device, it confirms whether an area is radioactive. Otherwise, they can attempt a difficulty 4 Intellect roll to correctly correlate the telltale signs of a radiation hazard with its actual presence. Even if PCs fail this roll, they still understand that some kind of dangerous residue is blighting the area, whether it’s radiation, poison, evil spirits, nanites, or something else.

Radiation Damage

Especially intense radiation, such as might be found at the center of an area bearing telltale signs of contamination, harms PCs soon after they are exposed.

Immediate Effects of Exposure: When PCs are exposed to dangerous radiation without shielding, they suffer 3 points of ambient damage per minute each time they fail a difficulty 3 Might defense task; on a success they still take 1 point of ambient damage. If they spend more than ten minutes in the area, or fail three Might defense rolls against radiation during any single period of radiation exposure, they are subject to radiation sickness (see the box below).

A character who has scavenged, repaired, or cobbled together a hazmat suit is still vulnerable, though less so. The suit eases a wearer’s Might defense tasks, though the wearer takes 1 point of ambient damage (because the suit provides +2 to Armor against damage from radiation) every few minutes with each failed defense roll. Unless they tear their suit or are otherwise compromised, they’re generally not subject to radiation sickness.

\*Dangerous radiation: Level 3

\*Taking iodine tablets eases Might defense rolls against radiation sickness by three steps.

Disease: Radiation Sickness

Level 8 disease: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue appear within minutes to hours of a PC contracting radiation sickness. Hours later, the PC may suffer skin burns and hair loss. Days later, they experience extreme weakness, weight loss, and potentially death.

Each day the PC fails a Might defense roll, they descend one step on the damage track. If they succeed on three Might defense rolls, they gradually improve and throw off the sickness effects within a few weeks.

### Scavenging, Repairing, And Building

Survivors need food and shelter in a world turned upside down.

When to Use: PCs in a post‑apocalyptic setting that aren’t prepared or that have lost access to their resources and base must usually spend part of each day scavenging for supplies and/or a place of safety. Scavenging is what happens anytime they search for food, water, and shelter.

Effect: Basic scavenging optional rules are described in the *Cypher System Rulebook*. However, if you’d like to provide the PCs with many more options, including rules for finding enough to eat and drink, a safe shelter, and more, use the following extended optional rules instead. The base scavenging rules have been incorporated here, so you don’t need to cross‑reference them to understand how it all works.

Food, Water, and Shelter

PCs in a post‑apocalyptic game may find themselves without food, water, shelter, and/or refuge for any number of reasons, including because that’s the situation you start them in, they’re exploring a new area, their settlement was overrun by raiders and they barely escaped with their lives, or something else.

Generally, characters must spend ten minutes to an hour searching through the rubble and ruins in a particular area before they have a chance of finding food or a refuge.

Characters who succeed in finding food and water or refuge also get to roll up to once each day on the Useful Stuff table and three times on the Junk table. (Some characters won’t care about rolling on the Junk table; no need to have them make rolls if that’s the case.) If a “food” or “water” result is obtained on the Useful Stuff table, PCs discover double the amount of resources and have enough for two days for six people.

Consider using a GM intrusion to add additional color by way of an unexpected threat or hazard as they search, especially if they roll a 1 on their task. It’s a dangerous world, and the PCs are not the only ones out scavenging for resources.

Food and Water

Found food often takes the form of canned, processed, dried, or otherwise preserved goods from before the apocalypse, but sometimes it includes fresh fruits and vegetables growing wild or cultivated by other survivors.

Found water might be canned seltzer water, water in casks, water in tanks, and other leftovers from the before‑times, but it could just as easily be collected rainwater, from a river, from a lake, or water secured by previous survivors.

Scavenging and Related Tasks

| Level | Task |
|----|----|
| 5 | Find enough food and clean water for a group of five characters to eat and drink for one dya |
| 5 | Find a place of relative safety to regroup, shelter from the elements, and hide from other dangerous groups or creatures |
| \- | The task is hindered by one step from every two more people (above 5) a scavenger tries to find resources or a refuge for |
| \+ | The task is eased by one step for every two fewer people (from a baseline of 5) a scavenger tries to find resources or a refuge for |

Changing Conditions Affect Scavenger Success

The difficulty of finding food, water, and a safe place varies by location and by how many days the characters have already spent there.

Right After the Apocalypse: Things may be somewhat picked over, but PCs probably have their choice of food, water, shelter, and useful things, assuming the apocalypse isn’t one that also devastates large swaths of the immediate environment.

Months and Years After the Apocalypse: Other survivors who’ve already scavenged the area and exposure to the elements make scavenging more difficult as time marches on. Each week the PCs spend in the same area (that’s not an allied settlement) hinders subsequent scavenging tasks by one additional step. The result of failing to find food and water is obvious; if you’re using it, refer to the exposure, starvation, and dehydration optional rule.

Staying in One Place Too Long: In an unsafe area, PCs who’ve found shelter must succeed on a new difficulty 5 Intellect task each week to determine if their refuge is still safe. If they fail to find—or keep—a refuge, the place becomes compromised in some way. For instance, perhaps their presence is noticed by a hostile force in the area (raiders, a dangerous wild animal, a mutated creature, and so on), or a result from the Realistic Threats and Hazards table becomes evident.

## USEFUL STUFF

Food, water, and a safe place to rest are the most important results for any scavenging task. But other obviously useful stuff is often found along with these basic requirements.

When to Consult the Table: When a group of characters successfully finds food and water or a safe place, they also find something else that’s potentially useful. Consult the Useful Stuff table up to once per day, or two or three times if PCs roll a special minor or major effect, respectively. If it’s the first day they have scavenged in a particular area, each character might find something useful on the table, but on subsequent days, a group normally gets only a single roll.

Subtables: Roll on a specific subtable only if you wish to provide additional flavor to what PCs find.

Useful? The implication is that if PCs find something on the Useful Stuff table, it’s in working condition, having beaten the odds of degradation and destabilization facing all common things from the before‑times. A GM intrusion, of course, could complicate that for any given item.

Artifact? As described under Pre‑Apocalyptic Artifacts, almost every nonfood item on the Useful Stuff table could be considered an artifact, given that it is increasingly difficult to produce or preserve. Adding a depletion roll (usually 1 in 1d20) represents the likelihood that the item will fall apart, break down, or run out.

Useful Stuff Table

Most of the time, it’s not important to know the level of a useful item PCs find. If it becomes important, level 3 is a good baseline. If the item is particularly fragile (such as a wheel of cheese preserved in wax), drop the level by 1 or 2. If the item is particularly hardy (like a fire engine), increase the level by 1 or 2.

## JUNK

Scavenging always turns up junk, most of it unusable because the underpinnings of civilization that it required to function— such as a power grid and/or a worldwide internet—no longer exist. Characters are free to ignore that junk. But some PCs might have a use for it. That includes PCs with the Scavenges focus, as well as any character that decides to take advantage of the Repairing and Building section described in this optional rule.

When to Consult the Table: All characters gain up to three results from the Junk table each time they successfully scavenge for food and water, or a safe place to stay. Junk can sometimes be repaired. It can also be disassembled, warped, melted, or otherwise used to craft or repair something else.

How Much Junk PCs Get: Each time PCs roll on the Junk table or otherwise obtain a specific kind of junk, the amount they get is called a “load.” Load is an intentionally vague amount, because it represents a variable amount of junk of a particular kind. A PC that finds some electronic junk could grab a single broken electric fan or leave a ruined house with a shopping cart full of stereo parts. Either way, it’s considered one load of electronic junk.

Tracking Loads: It’s only important to track the number and kinds of loads a PC acquires if they’re going to use the Repairing and Building optional rules presented later in this section. A PC can carry one load of junk along with their equipment. To carry more than that, they need a plan, such as using a toy wagon, shopping cart, sled, vehicle, or mount; asking an ally for help; or something else.

Junk

|  |  |
|:--:|----|
| D10 | Variety of Junk |
| 1 | Electronic (stereo, DVD/Blu‑ray player, smartphone, electric fan, printer, router, etc.) |
| 2 | Plastic (lawn furniture, baby seat, simple toys, inflatable pool, etc.) |
| 3 | Chemical (cleaning solution, fuel, paint, rat poison, solvents, industrial chemicals, etc.) |
| 4 | Metal (old playsets, grills, empty barrels, frying pan, metal siding, etc.) |
| 5 | Glass (vases, windows, bowls, decorative pieces, etc.) |
| 6 | Textile (coats, pants, shirts, bathing suits, blankets, rugs, paper currency, etc.) |
| 7 | Vehicle (car/airplane/watercraft bodies, scavenged electronics, tires, seats, etc.) |
| 8 | Construction (cinder blocks, lumber, siding, wiring, pipes, bricks, insulation, shingles, etc.) |
| 9 | Medical (syringes, IV pumps, defibrillators, microscopes, centrifuges, CT scanners, etc.) |
| 10 | Unearthly (weird components, alloys, and materials scavenged from alien spacecraft) |

## REPAIRING AND BUILDING

Improvised Basis for Repairing and Building: In the aftermath, survivors use whatever they can scavenge to repair, craft, and build. The upshot is twofold. First, things survivors have repaired or built have a more rough‑and‑ready look to them. A new or repaired home could be covered in scavenged street signs. Clothing is probably a mishmash of textiles, salvaged bits from costume stores, and plastic bags. A suit of armor might be made of trash can lids. And so on. Second, even if something looks rough‑and‑ready, such as armor made of trash can lids, if PCs succeed on the task to create medium armor (or heavy armor, if they’re feeling ambitious), the resulting armor is functionally equivalent to armor of the same grade made before the apocalypse. It just looks less polished.

Improving the Odds: If PCs scavenge exactly the right tools for the job (such as a hammer instead of a rock) and/or the perfect construction and repair supplies (such as steel screws instead of pegs carved from wood), they may gain an asset to their task.

Junk Required for Building vs. Repairing: The “Loads of Junk Required” column in the Repairing and Crafting Difficulty and Time table is calibrated for repair. If a PC builds something from scratch (as opposed to repairing something previously built), the junk requirements are twice to ten times the indicated number of loads. Something small to moderate (like an article of clothing or a wheelbarrow) requires double the loads, while something large, like a structure or large motorized vehicle, could require up to ten times the indicated junk loads. You, the GM, decide what’s reasonable.

Other Projects: If the character wants to try to repair or build something from the ground up that isn’t on the table, use your best judgment, comparing to what is on the table as a baseline. Some things just can’t be built with the tools, materials, and knowledge the PCs have available. For instance, they probably can’t build a spacecraft. On the other hand, perhaps they can repair one if they find an old government base containing a secret orbital craft that was never used, as long as they find specialized tools and instructions to go with it.

Repair and Build Time: PCs who reduce the difficulty of a project cannot, generally speaking, reduce the repair or build time indicated. If they want to go faster anyway, you can call it a rush job (with appropriate consequences), as noted in the Cypher System Rulebook.

## EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE

When to Use: Use this optional rule to add a bit more verisimilitude to living in a world where you can’t easily replace a broken appliance or tool by buying something online. This rule works well with the Repairing and Building section of the larger optional rule for scavenging, repairing, and building, because if something breaks due to lack of maintenance, PCs should have a chance to fix it.

Effect: Sometimes, a piece of equipment a PC relies on breaks. Use a GM intrusion to let the character know. PCs who know—or who learn—that equipment wear and breakage is a possibility can be proactive. They can spend about an hour on equipment maintenance each week. Maintenance requires the PC to expend 1 load of metal or construction junk each week, or to break down a few related items of scavenged useful stuff to get what they need. If PCs put in the time to keep their gear in good condition, they should face fewer, if any, GM intrusions related to their equipment failing them. No roll is required for maintenance, and after PCs commit to this practice, it’s usually not important to track the time thereafter, unless a special circumstance occurs.

\*Load requirements for buildings (vs. repairing) are two to ten times the indicated values.

Handloading Tool Set

A set of handloading tools includes a variety of instruments such as lubricant, powder funnel, and a small press, used to create ammunition for a firearm. To fashion ammunition, the user must spend an uninterrupted hour using the handloading tools, at the end of which time they have created about 25 bullets.

If treated as a Pre‑Apocalyptic Artifact, the handloading tool set has a depletion of 1 in 1d20 (upon depletion, the set can be recharged with 1 load of metal junk and 1 load of chemical junk).

## IRONMAN

This optional rule pares back some of the better‑than‑normal advantages that Cypher System PCs have over most regular people.

When to Use: To really drive home the brutality of a post‑apocalyptic survival one‑shot game or short scenario, you can subject your players to this hardcore optional rule.

Effect: There are no cyphers (subtle or manifest) or artifacts that heal, and all other healing effects (such as recovery rolls and Healing Touch) restore only the minimum amount possible. For example, a tier 2 character making a recovery roll would get only 3 points (as if they rolled a 1 on a d6, plus 2 for their tier) to add to their Pools. This results in a gritty, dire scenario where the only way PCs can restore their Pools is with recovery rolls and character abilities that heal.

Cypher System characters are tough and resilient, even at tier 1, but the ironman rule brings them down to a more realistic power level. Ironman is more punitive for characters whose abilities cost Pool points and less of a challenge for characters whose abilities don’t cost anything (such as Physical Skills). For a slightly less challenging option, allow the use of healing cyphers and artifacts, but limit them to the minimum amount.

## FRAGILITY

This optional rule prevents power creep in PCs.

When to Use: If you want your players to have a gritty game experience after the apocalypse, this optional rule keeps them physically humble.

Effect: Whenever a character selects the Increasing Capabilities option for advancement or gains an ability that permanently increases their Pools, they can

add a maximum of 1 point to their Might Pool and 1 point to their Speed Pool; other points left over (if any) must go to their Intellect Pool, even if that’s not normally an option for the ability. This does not apply to the extra points the player can divide among their Pools at character creation. This rule creates a more “realistic” scenario in which the PCs are more like normal people who don’t get much more powerful physically over the course of a campaign but still can learn new skills, advance their minds, and so on. This module does not affect abilities like Enlarge (which temporarily adds 4 points to your Might Pool), but it does affect abilities like Enhanced Might, Enhanced Speed, and Lead From the Front (which permanently increase one or more Pools).

## ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH

Many popular post‑apocalyptic stories feature salvage in the form of highly advanced or even alien technology.

When to Use: If the apocalypse that ended your world featured a time rip, alien invaders, a catastrophic alien ship crash, a starting date that is several decades into our own future, or an alternate timeline where things happened differently in the past than in the real world, this rule is applicable. You can also use it if you just want to introduce a bit of mystery to your game that will confound PCs’ expectations on how their world really ended.

Effect: Fantastic and advanced devices exist in the setting, and PCs can find them. If something is advanced and/or alien enough, PCs may have to develop special skills to use it, as noted hereafter. The existence of this tech in your setting may also imply the existence of other fantastic rules in your game, such as grey goo or terraforming by aliens, but the tech could just as easily stand alone or be part of an End of Days theme.

## ADVANCED ARTIFACTS AND FANTASTIC MANIFEST CYPHERS

In a setting featuring remnants of advanced and/or alien technology, PCs scavenging for supplies or defeating foes could discover unusual objects in the form of fantastic cyphers and unusual post‑apocalyptic artifacts.

## UNDERSTANDING ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH

Recognizing and using unfamiliar technology is difficult enough. If something is especially advanced or alien, it’s even harder.

Identifying and Using Advanced and Alien Tech: When a character finds a manifest cypher or an artifact that falls into this category, they must identify it before they can use it. Identification takes from one to ten minutes and a successful Intellect roll, usually against a difficulty of 5. Identifying an object grants PCs the ability to use the object, whether it’s a manifest cypher or an artifact.

However, without training or specialization in alien technology, advanced technology, or something similar (which most starting characters don’t have), a character has an inability in understanding advanced and alien tech.

Failing to Understand: Sometimes a failed roll to understand an object of advanced or alien tech simply means the character can’t figure it out, but they can try again (as usual, each task retry requires that the PC expend Effort). Other times, there’s a chance of something going wrong, either because you intrude or because the character triggers an intrusion. Use the following table to inspire appropriate GM intrusions or anytime something disruptive happens to an advanced or alien device in a PC’s possession.

## ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH GM INTRUSIONS

Unless the advanced device detonates or is otherwise noted as becoming nonfunctional, PCs with the time can try to understand how to use it again after resolving the intrusion.

|  |  |
|:--:|----|
| d10 | Result of Intrusion |
| 1 | Ooze sprays the character, then hardens, trapping them until they can escape a level 4 “shell.” |
| 2 | Device becomes stuck in midair, immovable as if caught in invisible, otherwise intangible cement. |
| 3 | Device grows increasingly hot over the course of one minute, then fuses into a nonfunctional lump. |
| 4 | Device shoots like a bullet in a random direction for a long distance, lodging itself in a structure or tree. |
| 5 | Very bright light flashes from the device, blinding the PC for a few minutes. |
| 6 | A blue light on the device begins flashing; if device is not destroyed, an alien enthraller investigates. |
| 7 | Device function is triggered, as are any other devices (cyphers and/or artifacts) the PC carries. |
| 8 | Mutagenic energy pulse; character develops a distinctive mutation over the course of ten hours. |
| 9 | Device breaks in half (becoming nonfunctional) and spills some sort of grey goo on the character. |
| 10 | Device detonates, inflicting damage equal to its level on everything within short range on a failed Speed defense roll, or 2 points of damage even with a successful roll. |

## INCREDIBLE MUTATIONS

Exposure to dangerous amounts of radiation inflicts damage. Enough exposure causes cellular mutations, cancer, and death, as described under Radiation in the Real World. However, in the right game setting, radiation (or genetic engineering, or some other mutagen) can instill strange new abilities in previously normal creatures, plants, NPCs, and even PCs, though often with a few drawbacks, too.

When to Use: If you’d like your setting to include incredible mutations, this section is for you. Why does your game have such mutations? Maybe because of an X‑factor in some survivors’ DNA, inscrutable nanites that have permeated the environment, magical contamination, or multiple different timelines collapsing into one.

Effect: This section describes several ways to introduce incredible mutations to your game, including letting the environment evoke the concept, PC opt‑in, transitory mutations PCs have less control over, and transitory mutations based on cyphers. You can pick one or two, or use them all at different times and for different needs in your game.

Mutated Creatures, Plants, and NPCs

The environment can reflect the possibility of mutagenic presence even if PCs haven’t yet been affected. The appearance of a creature, plant, or NPC often reveals the presence and severity of a mutation. Some creatures and animals may have only harmful mutations, but others could have adaptive mutations.

Harmful Mutations: Some creatures, plants, trees, fungus, and NPCs could present with disturbing, harmful mutations, such as the following examples. Their tasks are usually hindered.

- An animal with one or more additional, vestigial, limp limbs, or an additional vestigial head that appears almost as a tumor‑like growth

- Oozing a smelly, rotting fluid that stains and slightly burns exposed skin

- Lack of fur combined with albinism, making them sensitive to light and subject to skin cancer

- Too many extra fingers or arms, making them slow and heavy

- Too many extra branches, or too spindly, making the branches prone to breaking

- Feathers growing where they normally wouldn’t, in ragged, uncomfortable clumps

- Fishlike scales growing where they normally wouldn’t, like itchy, reflective sores

- Single limb or other body part is radically larger than normal, making the creature clumsy

- Big clumps of fungal growth that are obviously intrusive and painful

Adaptive Mutations

A disturbing mutation might only look strange and not be an impediment to the animal, plant, or NPC. It might even provide some benefit, as follows.

- Fur, hair, or leaves growing in strange fractal patterns. Maybe it glows visibly to attract prey, or glows at a frequency normally invisible to the human eye, but which they can see, allowing them to act in the dark.

- Tentacle‑like arms that work like the regular limb replaced, or an extra tentacle‑like arm that gives the creature a method to grasp, use tools, or otherwise gain an additional benefit over other creatures or plants of its type.

- Feathers growing on an animal or plant they normally wouldn’t, thick enough to provide additional warmth, protection, and possibly limited flight options.

- Insects, like ants or beetles, that learn how to spin webs, or spiders that begin spinning wildly strong fractal webs that glow and change, maybe serving as a mode of communication.

- Fungal growths that seem to connect the minds of creatures that have the same kind of growth.

## OPTIONAL RULE: MUTANT DESCRIPTOR

If a PC wants to play a mutant, they may do so by choosing Mutant as their descriptor. Mutations gained by a character with the Mutant descriptor are always rolled randomly, although you should work with your player to ensure that the resulting PC is one that the player wants to play.

## OPTIONAL RULE: TRANSITORY MUTATIONS

Use this optional rule if you’d prefer some flux in what mutations the PCs have available. A volatile mutation is one that mutates into something different over time. When using this rule, a volatile mutation arises spontaneously or is triggered, replacing the specific benefit (or drawback) of the volatile mutation previously granted to the PC.

You can use this optional rule instead of the mutant descriptor optional rule, or allow both in the same game. If using transitory mutations, not every PC in your game needs to have a volatile mutation.

Volatile Mutations

A character can begin the game with one volatile mutation that changes during play, one distinctive mutation that usually does not change, and, at their option, one or two cosmetic mutations.

Alternatively, the PC could gain a volatile mutation (and one distinctive mutation) after their first encounter with radiation or some other mutagenic agent. Additional encounters with radiation don’t give a PC further volatile mutations but could cause the one they have to mutate into something else.

Effect: If the PC gains a volatile mutation, roll randomly on the Beneficial Mutations table. That mutation lasts until a triggering event occurs, at which time their volatile mutation is replaced, as indicated. A character normally cannot trigger replacement simply by willing it to occur, but they could choose to fail the Intellect defense roll that some triggers require to maintain their current volatile mutation.

Adjusting the Volatility: Choose which triggering events apply to determine how volatile you’d like transitory mutations to be in your setting. For instance, if you prefer that volatile mutations change only when PCs encounter radiation, choose that option and ignore the others. Alternatively, you might prefer more variability and use most or even all the triggering events noted.

Triggering Events:

- The character finishes a ten‑hour recovery; replace with a randomly rolled beneficial mutation.

- A character takes damage for the first time in ten hours and fails a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll; replace with a randomly rolled beneficial mutation, assuming the character’s roll isn’t a 1, 19, or 20.

- The character triggers or receives a GM intrusion; replace with a random roll on the Harmful Mutations table.

- The character gains a minor effect on a d20 roll and decides the effect is that their volatile mutation changes; replace with two randomly rolled beneficial mutations. Both are replaced the next time the character gains a new volatile mutation.

- The character gains a major effect on a d20 roll and decides the effect is that their volatile mutation changes; replace with a random result from the Powerful Mutations table. It is replaced the next time the character gains a new volatile mutation.

- The character takes damage from radiation (or other established mutagen in your setting) for the first time in ten hours and fails an Intellect defense roll against a difficulty equal to the attack; replace with a randomly rolled beneficial mutation, assuming the character’s roll isn’t a 1, 19, or 20.

Cyphers as Volatile Mutations

If a character has volatile mutations, one way to handle it is to give them an additional subtle cypher slot, and their volatile mutation is whatever subtle cypher is in that slot. A character can begin the game with one cypher volatile mutation that changes during play (or gain it after surviving radiation damage) and one distinctive mutation that usually does not change, plus—at their option—one or two cosmetic mutations.

Effect: A cypher volatile mutation operates almost entirely like regular volatile mutations, except as follows.

- Any random roll on the Beneficial Mutations table should instead be a random roll on the Subtle Cypher table. That includes the two rolls granted to PCs who use a special minor effect to replace their volatile mutation’s effect.

- A roll of 1 still replaces the PC’s volatile mutation with a randomly rolled harmful mutation.

- A roll of 20 still replaces the PC’s volatile mutation with a randomly rolled powerful mutation.

- A cypher volatile mutation can be used more than once before it is replaced, but each additional attempt to use it requires that the character succeed on an Intellect task. The difficulty of the task begins at the level of the cypher and increases by one step each additional time the character attempts to reuse the mutation. On a failed roll, the mutation is replaced.

- When the cypher volatile mutation is replaced, roll the level for the new mutation.

Other Consequences of Volatile Mutations

If a character gains a mutation that grants them points to a Pool (such as strengthened bones, which gives +5 Might), then later loses it, the maximum value in their Pool goes back to what it was before. This might or might not affect their current Pool value, depending on whether they were completely healthy or not.

D100 BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS

The following mutations do not require any visible changes or distinctions in the character. In other words, people who have these mutations are not obviously recognized as mutants. Using beneficial mutations never costs stat Pool points and never requires an action to “activate.”

01–05 Strengthened bones: You gain +5 to your Might Pool.

06–10 Improved circulation: You gain +5 to your Might Pool.

11–15 Improved musculature: You gain +5 to your Might Pool.

16–20 Improved nervous system: You gain +5 to your Speed Pool.

21–25 Improved neural processes: You gain +5 to your Intellect Pool.

26–30 Thick hide: You gain +1 to Armor.

31–33 Increased lung capacity: You can hold your breath for five minutes.

34–36 Adhesion pads: Your hands and feet have naturally adhesive pads and thus are assets in tasks involving climbing, keeping your footing, or retaining your grip.

37–39 Slippery skin: You secrete a slippery oil, giving you an asset in any task involving slipping from another’s grip, slipping from bonds, squeezing through a small opening, and so on.

40–45 Telekinetic shield: You reflexively use telekinesis to ward away attacks, giving you an asset in Speed defense tasks.

46–50 Suggestive voice: Your voice is so perfectly modulated that it is an asset in all interaction tasks.

51–53 Processor dreams: When you sleep, you process information so that after you wake, you have an asset in any Intellect actions held over from the previous day. For example, if you have to determine whether an unknown plant is poisonous, you could “sleep on it” and make the determination the next day with an asset on the action.

54–60 Poison immunity: You are immune to all poisons.

61–65 Disease immunity: You are immune to all diseases.

66–70 Fire resistance: You have +3 to Armor against damage from fire.

71–75 Cold resistance: You have +4 to Armor against damage from cold.

76–80 Psychic resistance: You have +3 to Armor against Intellect damage.

81–85 Acid resistance: You have +5 to Armor against damage from acid.

86–88 Puncture resistance: You have +2 to Armor against damage from puncturing attacks.

89–91 Slicing resistance: You have +2 to Armor against damage from slicing attacks.

92–94 Bludgeoning resistance: You have +2 to Armor against damage from crushing attacks.

95–96 No scent: You cannot be tracked or located by scent, and you never have offensive odors.

97–99 Scent: You can sense creatures, objects, and terrain by scent as well as a normal human can by sight. You can detect scents with that degree of accuracy only in short range, but you can sense strong odors from much farther away (far better than a normal human can). Like a hound, you can track creatures by their scent.

00 Sense material: You can sense the presence of any single substance within short range, although you don’t learn details or the precise location. You and the GM should work together to determine the substance: water, iron, plastic, granite, wood, flesh, salt, and so on. You do not need to concentrate to sense the material.

D100 HARMFUL MUTATIONS  
Unless noted otherwise, the following mutations are visible and obvious. They offer no benefits, only drawbacks.

01–10 Deformed leg: All movement tasks are hindered.

11–20 Deformed face/appearance: All pleasant interaction tasks are hindered.

21–30 Deformed arm/hand: All tasks involving the arm or hand are hindered.

31–40 Malformed brain: All memory‑ or cognitive‑related tasks are hindered.

41–45 Mentally vulnerable: All Intellect defense tasks are hindered.

46–50 Slow and lumbering: All Speed defense tasks are hindered.

51–60 Sickly: All Might defense tasks are hindered.

61–63 Horrible growth: A large goiter, immobile tendril, or useless extra eye hangs from your face, hindering all pleasant interactions (with most creatures, particularly humans).

64–66 Useless limb: One of your limbs is unusable or missing.

67–71 Useless eye: One of your eyes is unusable or missing. Tasks specifically involving eyesight (spotting, searching, and so on) are hindered.

72–76 Useless ear: One of your ears is unusable or missing. Tasks specifically involving hearing are hindered.

77–84 Weakness in Might: Any time you spend points from your Might Pool, the cost is increased by 1 point.

85–92 Weakness in Speed: Any time you spend points from your Speed Pool, the cost is increased by 1 point.

93–00 Weakness in Intellect: Any time you spend points from your Intellect Pool, the cost is increased by 1 point.

## CRIPPLING MUTATIONS

A sixth category exists that might be called crippling or nonviable mutations. PCs never have this kind of mutation. Mutants with nonviable mutations might be born without limbs, with barely functional lungs, without most of their brain, and so on. Such mutations prevent a character from being viable.

D100 POWERFUL MUTATIONS

The following mutations do not require any visible changes in the character until used. People who have these mutations are not obviously recognized as mutants if they don’t use their powers. Using some of these mutations costs stat Pool points. Some are actions.

01–05 Darksight: You can see in complete darkness as if it were light. Enabler.

06–10 No breath: You do not need to breathe. Enabler.

11–15 No water: You do not need to drink water to survive. Enabler.

16–20 Chameleon skin: Your skin changes colors as you wish. This is an asset in tasks involving hiding. Enabler.

21–24 Savage bite: Your mouth widens surprisingly, and hidden, pointed teeth emerge when you wish it. You can make a bite attack that inflicts 3 points of damage. Enabler.

25–26 Gluey globs: You can produce gluey globs at your fingertips. This is an asset in tasks involving climbing or keeping your grip. You can also fling these globs in immediate range, and if they hit, they hinder the target’s physical tasks for one round. Enabler to use in a task; action to use as an attack.

27–30 Face dancing: You can alter your features enough to give you an asset in all tasks involving disguise. Enabler.

31–35 Sense oddity: You can sense the presence of an object or creature possessing fantastic abilities (because of alien technology, transdimensional interference, nanites, or similar) within short range. You do not learn details or the precise location. Action.

36–40 Stinger in finger: You can make an attack with your hand that inflicts 1 point of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, your stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). Action.

41–44 Stinger in elbow: You can make an attack with your elbow that inflicts 2 points of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, your stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). Action.

45–47 Spit needles: You can make an attack with immediate range. You spit a needle that inflicts 1 point of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, the needle also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). Action.

48–50 Spit acid: You can make an attack with immediate range. You spit a glob of acid that inflicts 2 points of damage. Action.

51–53 Spit webs: You can make up to 10 feet (3.5 m) of a strong, ropelike material each day at the rate of about 1 foot (30 cm) per minute. The webbing is level 3. You can also spit globs of webbing in immediate range, and if they hit, the target’s physical tasks are hindered for one round. Action.

54–59 Filtered lungs: You have an asset to Might defense rolls against vapors or noxious gases. You can survive in a hostile breathing environment (such as underwater or in a vacuum) for up to ten minutes. Enabler.

60–62 Disruptive field (electronics) (2 Intellect points): When you wish it, you disrupt devices within immediate range (no roll needed). All devices operate as if they were 3 levels lower while in range of your field. Devices reduced to level 0 or below do not function. Action.

63–65 Disruptive field (flesh) (2 Intellect points): When you wish it, you disrupt flesh within immediate range. All creatures within range of your field take 1 point of damage. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage rather than affect the difficulty, each target takes 2 additional points of damage. If your attack fails, targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.

66–68 Disruptive field (thoughts) (1 Intellect point): When you wish it, you disrupt thoughts within immediate range. Intellect actions for all creatures within range are hindered. Action.

69–70 Magnetic flesh: You attract or repel metal when you desire. Not only do small metal objects cling to you, but this mutation is an asset in tasks involving climbing on metal or keeping your grip on a metal item. This mutation is an asset to Speed defense tasks when being attacked by a metal foe or a foe with a metal weapon. Enabler.

71–73 Gravity negation (2 Intellect points): You float slowly into the air. If you concentrate, you can control your movement at half your normal speed; otherwise, you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes. Action to initiate.

74–80 Telepathy (2 Intellect points): You can speak telepathically with others who are within short range. Communication is two‑way, but the other party must be willing and able to communicate. You don’t have to see the target, but you must know that it’s within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for

using Effort, you can use a level of Effort to increase the duration of contact to a full day. Action to establish contact.

81–85 Pyrokinesis (1 Intellect point): You can cause a flammable object you can see within immediate range to spontaneously catch fire. If used as an attack, this power inflicts 2 points of damage. Action.

86–90 Telekinesis (2 Intellect points): You can exert force on objects within short range. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable, adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3.5 m). This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it’s not a means of attack. You can’t use this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool is depleted, whichever comes first. Action.

91–92 Phase shifting (2 Intellect points): You can pass slowly through solid barriers at a rate of 1 inch (3 cm) per round (minimum of one round to pass through the barrier). You can’t act (other than moving) or perceive anything until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can’t pass through energy barriers. Action.

93–94 Power device (1+ Intellect points): You can charge an artifact or other device (except a cypher) so that it can be used once. The cost is 1 Intellect point plus 1 point per level of the device. Action.

95–96 Drain power: You can drain the power from an artifact or device, allowing you to regain 1 Intellect point per level of the device. You regain points at the rate of 1 point per round and must give your full concentration to the process each round. The GM determines whether the device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller devices) or retains some power (likely true of large machines). Action to initiate; action each round to drain.

97–99 Regeneration: In addition to regaining points through normal recovery rolls, you regain 1 point to your Might Pool or Speed Pool per hour, regardless of whether you rest, until both Pools are at their maximum. Enabler.

00 Feed off pain: Any time a creature within immediate range suffers at least 3 points of damage (after Armor subtraction) in one attack, you can restore 1 point to one of your Pools, up to its maximum. You can feed off any creature in this way, whether friend or foe. You never regain more than 1 point per round. Enabler.

D100 DISTINCTIVE MUTATIONS  
The following mutations involve dramatic physical changes to the character’s appearance. People who have these mutations are always recognized as mutants. Using some of these mutations costs stat Pool points. Some are actions.

01–02 Extra eye: You have an extra eye on your forehead that you normally keep closed, but you can open it in dim light and see as if in bright light, and see in total darkness as if in very dim light. Enabler.

03–04 Extra mouth: You have an extra mouth on your hand, face, or stomach. This mouth is filled with razor‑sharp teeth and, if used to attack, inflicts 3 points of damage. You can also speak with two voices at once. Enabler.

05–06 Proboscis: You have a long, moth‑like proboscis instead of a mouth. You can speak, but your voice is ever‑so‑slightly muffled. You take all your nutrition as a liquid, but you can gain sustenance from most plants by inserting the sharp tip of your proboscis into it. You can also feed on the blood of living (or recently living) creatures. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

07–09 Snakelike arm: One of your arms ends in a fanged mouth. You can use it to attack, inflicting 3 points of damage. If you make a second successful attack with the arm, you also inject a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). You can’t use the snakelike arm for anything other than biting. Enabler.

10–12 Tendrils on forehead: Four to six tendrils, each 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) long, come out of your forehead. They can grasp and carry anything that your hand could, although a large object would block your field of vision. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

13–15 Tendrils instead of fingers: Your fingers are tendrils 1 foot (30 cm) long. They are an asset to any task involving climbing, grasping, or keeping your grip. Further, you can effectively pick up and hold two objects in each hand rather than one. You can’t wield more than one weapon per hand. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

16–18 Tendrils instead of arms: Your arms are tendrils 6 feet (2 m) long (or only one arm is a tendril, if you prefer). Although you lose the fine manipulative ability of fingers and a thumb, you can still grasp objects, have a much longer reach, and have an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

19–21 Tendrils instead of eyes: You are blind, but each eye socket has a retractable tendril that is 10 feet (3.5 m) long. These tendrils can feel around rapidly to give you a physical sense of everything within immediate range. Further, they can be used to manipulate very light objects, activate controls, and so forth. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

22–24 Tendrils instead of legs/feet: Your legs or feet are tendrils that are 6 feet (2 m) long (or only one leg or foot is a tendril, if you prefer). You can still walk and move normally, and you have an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. The tendrils are prehensile enough to grasp large objects. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

25–26 Roots instead of feet: If you take a minute to burrow your roots into the ground in conjunction with making a recovery roll, add +2 to the points regained from the roll. You can’t move from where you rooted for one minute, even if taking what is normally a one‑action recovery roll. Enabler.

27–29 Scaly body: You gain +2 to Armor. Enabler.

30–32 Shaggy fur: You gain +1 to Armor (+2 against damage from cold) and have an asset on stealth tasks. Enabler.

33–35 Covered in spiny needles/spikes: Any creature striking you with its body automatically suffers 1 point of damage. Enabler.

36–38 Quills: You have quills that you can launch from your body to attack a foe within short range. This attack inflicts 4 points of damage, and you never run out of ammo. You can also use this attack in melee. Action.

39–41 Carapace: You gain +2 to Armor. Enabler.

42–44 Mirrored skin: You gain +2 to Armor against heat, radiation, lasers, and similar attacks. Enabler.

45–47 Chlorophyll: You gain nutrients from the sun and don’t need to eat or breathe if you have daily exposure to sunlight. Your skin, not surprisingly, is green. Enabler.

48–50 Covered in bursting pods: Fruit‑like pods grow here and there across your entire body. You can walk and move normally. As your action, you can rupture one pod, creating a burst of color, sound, and odor that dazes all creatures within immediate range on their next turn, hindering their tasks. Enabler.

51–53 Extra joint in arms: Your arms are long and jointed so that you have two elbows in each. You have a long reach and can strike foes from unexpected angles. This mutation is an asset when making melee attacks. However, you can modify your attacks only by using Speed, not Might. Enabler.

54–56 Extra joint in legs: Your legs are long and jointed so that you have two knees in each. You have a long stride, and this mutation is an asset for all running, climbing, jumping, and balancing tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

57–59 Rubbery body: Your bluish‑grey body is rubbery through and through. You can act normally and can stretch just your arms to reach things within immediate range that would normally require you to move. You can ignore up to 2 points of falling damage. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

60–62 Spider legs from torso: In addition to your normal limbs, six or eight spiderlike legs, each 6 feet (2 m) long, extend from your sides. They are an asset in any task involving running, keeping your feet, standing your ground, and climbing. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

63–65 Extra arms: You have one or two extra arms. They can hold objects, wield weapons, hold a shield, and so on. This mutation does not increase the number of actions you can take in a round or the number of attacks you can attempt. Enabler.

66–68 Extra legs: You have two extra legs. They are an asset in any task involving running, keeping your feet, and standing your ground. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

69–71 Spider legs: Instead of normal legs, you have a wide torso with six or eight spiderlike legs. They are an asset in any task involving running, keeping your feet, standing your ground, and climbing. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

72–74 Spider eyes: Instead of normal eyes, you have a crown of shiny orb‑like spider eyes. They provide an asset to initiative and perception tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

75–77 Snake tail: You have a prehensile tail that is 6 feet (2 m) long. It is an asset for all tasks ninvolving grappling or wrestling. The tail can grasp large objects. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

78–80 Snake tail instead of legs: Instead of legs, you have a snaky tail that is 8 feet (2.5 m) long. You move at the same speed and have an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. The tail is prehensile enough to grasp large objects. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

81–83 Stinging tendril: You have a prehensile tendril (or tail) that grows from some part of your body and ends in a poisonous stinger. You can make an attack with your stinger that inflicts 2 points of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, the stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). The tendril (or tail) can’t be used for anything else. Action.

84–86 Eyes on stalks: Your eyes are on stalks and can move in any direction, independently of each other. You can peek around corners without exposing yourself to danger. This is an asset in initiative and all perception tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

87–89 Extra eyes on hands/fingers: You can peek around corners without exposing yourself to danger. This is an asset in initiative and all perception tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler.

90–93 Abnormally large head: Your head is significantly larger than normal, with a bulging forehead and elongated skull. You gain two assets to any task involving knowledge, memory, lore, understanding, and figuring out puzzles. Enabler.

94–96 Aquatic: Your body is streamlined and finned, your fingers and toes webbed. You gain two assets in swimming, and you can see perfectly underwater (as if above water). Although you have lungs, you also have gills, so you can breathe underwater. Enabler.

97–98 Wings: You have feathered or fleshy wings on your back that allow you to glide, carried by the wind. They are not powerful enough to carry you aloft like a bird’s wings. Enabler.

99–00 Cyborg arm: One of your arms is a bulky organo‑metallic arm‑like living machine. You can project a ray of burning light from the arm at a target within short range as your action, inflicting 4 points of damage. You have no sense of touch with the arm or hand, so you are hindered when attempting physical tasks with that arm/hand and for tasks that require you to use both hands. Enabler.

\* Mutants aren’t just mutated humans. Animals and creatures of all kinds could have mutations in your game setting, as noted under Mutated Creatures, Plants, and NPCs. Very rarely, these mutations could make a nonhuman creature more like a human, with opposable thumbs, greater intelligence, and so on; see What Remains After Humans.

## COSMETIC MUTATIONS

Cosmetic mutations affect nothing but the appearance of a character. None are so pronounced as to make a character decidedly more or less attractive. They are simply distinguishing alterations.

**POST-APOCALYPTIC THREATS, HAZARDS, AND GM INTRUSIONS**

Using the Tables: Choose or roll randomly when you need a hazard to threaten the PCs. As described under scavenging, attempts to find food, water, useful stuff, or just a safe place to hole up could also require a roll on the table.

<tbody>
| 01-03 | Blocked road: The road ahead is so filled with abandoned, rusted before‑times vehicles that the PCs must walk if they want to take that route. Walkers are unable to see more than an immediate distance in any direction between the cars. If PCs have a vehicle larger than a bicycle, they’ll have to find another way or leave it behind.  |
| 04-06 | Setting‑specific element: Choose a hazard from a set piece or optional rule you’re using, or if you want to shake things up, roll on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table. Or just choose the next result on this table.  |
| 07-10 | Angry ants (level 2): Thousands of biting ants pour from cracks in the pavement, attacking everything in an immediate area, inflicting 2 points of damage if they hit a target and, on a failed Might defense roll, dazing targets with pain for one round. Even if a target succeeds on its initial Speed defense roll, it takes 1 point of damage because the ants are everywhere.  |
| 11-14 | Enraged wasps (level 3): This wasp swarm acts as a single level 3 creature whose stinging attacks ignore Armor. Attacks on the swarm that don’t deal area damage inflict only 1 point of damage.  |
| 15-17 | Cannibal convoy: A before‑times RV pulls up. It’s the current property of a group of four to ten people who make the biofuel the vehicle runs on. They seem nice, but they’re actually cannibals thinking of inviting the PCs for dinner.  |
| 18-20 | Earthquake, minor (level 3): The ground within long range of an epicenter heaves and shakes for one or more minutes. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage due to the general shaking on a failed Speed defense roll, or 6 points of damage if they are in or adjacent to a structure or terrain feature shedding debris on a failed Speed defense roll.  |
| 21-23 | Radioactive crater (level 3): Inflicts 3 points of ambient damage per round and moves the character one step down the damage track each day they fail a difficulty 5 Might defense task.  |
| 24-26 | Radioactive storm (level 3): Treat as a radioactive crater, but one that moves.  |
| 27-29 | Exposed electrical wiring, minor (level 3): Inflicts 3 points of damage per round of contact, and the character is stunned and unable to take their next action until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Might defense task.  |
| 30-33 | Dilapidated infrastructure, minor (level 3): The floor gives way beneath a character who falls 30 feet (9 m) on a failed Speed defense roll, taking 3 points of ambient damage and moving one step down the damage track.  |
| 34-40 | Poisoned waters, minor (level 3): Whether it’s water flooding a structure, a stream, a swamp, or a lake, drinking it inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 1 point of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task.  |
| 41-48 | Bridge, dangerous (level 4+): PCs on an overpass, train trestle, or other bridge must make a Speed defense roll as a section gives way beneath their feet, potentially dropping them 40 to 200 feet (12 to 60 m).  |
| 49-53 | Burning structure (level 4): Everything in or within immediate range of this fire takes 4 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. If PCs can’t get away, choking smoke in the area means they must succeed on Might defense rolls each round or suffer 2 points of ambient damage and lose their next action.  |
| 54-57 | Choking pollution (level 4): Asbestos and other substances once safely bound up in the infrastructure are loose, sometimes as clouds of dangerous particulate matter inflicting 4 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll.  |
| 58-67 | Raider patrol: Whether on scavenged trucks or motorcycles, or riding mutant pigs bred as war mounts (war pigs), a group of three to six fell riders is bad news.  |
| 68-72 | Avalanche (level 5): A rumble precedes the falling snow as an avalanche of snow threatens to bury the PCs. (The avalanche could be debris or rubble instead of snow.)  |
| 73-75 | Dilapidated infrastructure, major (level 5): The building, underpass tunnel, or cave collapses, or the bridge over which the vehicle is passing crumbles. Characters suffer 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 5 Speed task are buried under suffocating rubble until they can escape or are rescued. For additional danger, treat as an unstable structure.  |
| 76-78 | Disease (level 5+): Even if the world didn’t end because of a pandemic, disease threatens the PCs when they meet a group of especially unlucky (and diseased) survivors.  |
| 79-80 | Flooded region (level 5): A failed Speed defense roll means the rushing waters envelop the character, inflicting 5 points of damage and moving them a short distance in the direction of the water’s flow. A serious flood could further endanger the character.  |
| 81 | Firenado (level 5): Fire generates a vortex of flame and smoke, creating a rotating column of air that draws in flames and debris, resulting in a powerful whirlwind of fire. The vortex moves an immediate distance (on a roll of 1–3 on a d6) or a short distance (on a roll of 4–6 on a d6) each round in a random direction, persisting for 1d6 + 2 rounds before dispersing. Anyone intersected by the firenado’s immediate‑radius area takes 5 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. The PC must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled up into the firenado, burned for another 5 points of damage, and hurled in a random direction a short distance, which inflicts another 5 points of damage from falling and/or impacting other structures.  |
| 82-84 | Poisoned waters, major (level 5): Drinking this slightly glowing water inflicts 5 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task.  |
| 85-86 | Just a bear, but a big one: A regular grizzly bear is always frightening, before or after the end.  |
| 87-88 | Nuclear fallout (level 5): Radioactive dust drifts to the ground or precipitates out as rain. PCs in the area suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute, and if they remain for an hour or longer, they’re subject to radiation sickness.  |
| 89-91 | Toxic spill (level 5): Sticky orange goo bursts from rusted ancient barrels. Characters who fail a Speed defense task are caught and held in place until they can escape the morass, taking 5 points of damage each round they remain stuck.  |
| 92-94 | Unexploded ordnance (level 5): A buried land mine inflicts 5 points of damage to everything within short range if trod upon or otherwise set off.  |
| 95-97 | Superstorm (level 6): With the climate destabilized, storms of unprecedented strength sometimes blow, creating winds that inflict 6 points of damage each round targets are exposed.  |
| 98-99 | Radiation, extreme (level 8): This area was recently hit by a nuclear bomb or other extreme radioactive event, and those in the area for more than a minute who fail a Might defense roll suffer from radiation sickness.  |
| 00 | Unexploded nuclear warhead (level 10): If not defused, it could kill everything in a several‑mile radius and is likely radioactive to boot.  |

| 1 | Hallucinatory flowers (level 3): The ground floor of the ruin hosts a handful of purplish flowers growing up out of the rubble. A character who gets a puff of the pollen hallucinates their allies are actually cannibals trying to eat the affected character each round until the character succeeds on a Might defense roll.  |
| 2 | AI instance, minor (level 3): An artificial intelligence in an old facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.  |
| 3-4 | Voracious cockroach swarm (level 3): This swarm, easily covering an area a short distance in diameter, doesn’t shrink from the light or from people. Indeed, it seems eerily intelligent, and if threatened, it attacks, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on everything in its area that fails a Speed defense roll, or 1 point on a successful roll.  |
| 5 | Animate vegetation (level 4): Kudzu got a lot worse in the aftermath. Characters that fail a Speed defense roll take 4 points of damage each round from strangulation and vine constriction until they can escape  |
| 6 | Ashy tide (level 4): A series of powerful wind gusts in the area kicks up a lot of fine grey ash. Except it’s not ash—it’s a collection of nanobots, each the size of a grain of sand or smaller, called ashy tide.  |
| 7-8 | Glowing roach infestation: Four to ten glowing roaches the size of dogs have truly come into their own now that they’ve grown in stature and intelligence. They have little use for survivors, except as food.  |
| 9 | Psychic lichen (level 4): Psychic lichen gently attacks the minds of nearby creatures, causing them to grow tired and nap if they fail an Intellect defense roll. If not awakened, the dozing body serves as food for a new psychic lichen colony.  |
| 10 | Strike from the heavens (level 4): A before‑times war satellite becomes active and fires a focused microwave beam at the PCs in the area, inflicting 4 points of damage each round they remain in the area without solid cover and fail a Might defense roll, or 2 points on a successful roll.  |
| 11 | Abomination lair: The abomination was a person once, or its ancestors were. Not anymore.  |
| 12 | Fiery fissure (level 5): A crack splinters the ground along a newly forming fire‑filled fissure that stretches a long distance, zigging and zagging to catch several more targets than it might otherwise. PCs who fail a Speed defense roll fall in and are burned for 5 points of damage each round until they can climb out or be pulled out with a successful Might task as an action.  |
| 13 | Glowing tide (level 5): Veins of yellow‑gold light branching across surfaces (roads, buildings, and bare earth) indicate that nanites are probably active, creating a dangerous area of glowing tide.  |
| 14 | Time anomaly (level 5): The PCs encounter a wall of golden light whose interior ripples with lightning. It’s a time storm, and either it blocks the PCs’ path, or worse, it’s gradually sweeping toward the characters.  |
| 15 | AI instance, major (level 6): An artificial intelligence in a powered facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI (because an instance of the AI is running in their head). A target can make a new Intellect defense roll each day to try to reject the control. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.  |
| 16 | Hungry tide (level 6): A greyish‑green mist of nanobots a short distance in diameter drifts in the wind, until the hungry tide senses living organisms and moves a short distance each round toward them.  |
| 17 | Quantum singularity (level 6): Attempts to change the past to avert the apocalypse have consequences, including these points of unstable space‑time. Characters who fail an Intellect defense task are teleported a short distance in a random direction and possibly several hours forward in time.  |
| 18-19 | Rampaging wardroid (level 6): Wardroids may be what caused the apocalypse in the first place; whatever the case, one has wandered directly into the PCs’ path. |
| 20 | Mutant bear: The house‑sized radioactive bear, whose roar can be heard for miles, is something to avoid.  |

## GM INTRUSIONS FOR POST-APOCALYPTIC GAMES

If you’re running a game set in the ruins following civilization’s fall, refer to the following list of unexpected complications to your PCs’ day. GM intrusions can happen anytime, whether the PCs think they’re safe in a defended settlement or recently secured shelter, or traveling across the wasteland.

Select a GM intrusion appropriate to the situation, roll one randomly, or use the list to inspire an intrusion of your own.

01–02 (group): Roll on the preceding Realistic Threats and Hazards table, or on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table if your game includes fantastic elements.

03–04: The character is surprised by a diseased feral cat, which bites them and runs off, infecting the PC with a level 4 disease that drops them one step on the damage track each day they fail a Might defense roll.

05–06 (group or character): The PCs’ mode of transport breaks (or someone’s boot heel snaps off), requiring about an hour of repair, possibly meaning that they have to duck into nearby ruins to find parts.

07–08: A weirdly gnarled hand emerges from the ground or ruin, grabs the character, and pulls them down into an ancient bunker containing a zombie hulk.

09–10 (group): The PCs discover their food and water supplies have become contaminated with poisonous mold or dangerous levels of radiation (level 4).

11–12 (group): An unseasonal blizzard forces the PCs to seek shelter in an abandoned train yard, which shows signs of being claimed by another group of survivors.

13–14: The character treads on a sticky slurry of ooze leaking from a ruined factory that holds them in place unless they give up their footwear and/or succeed on a difficulty 5 Might task to pull free.

15–16: A radioactive spider bites the character, inflicting 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), and on a failed difficulty 3 Might defense roll, the character develops one harmful mutation. Each day the PC can attempt another Might defense roll; with a success, the mutation subsides.

17–18 (group): A wildfire or structural fire (level 5) moves through the area; PCs must run before it to survive. However, when the fire has burnt out several hours later, the PCs are lost.

19–20 (group): A sinkhole opens beneath the PCs’ vehicle, which becomes hopelessly stuck in loose earth until they can succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to push it out. If PCs don’t have a vehicle, the sinkhole sucks down one character and threatens to smother them unless the others succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to extract them.

21–22: The PC discovers they are infested with mutant green lice (level 5); Might tasks (including defense rolls) are hindered until the PC is treated with appropriate cleansing chemicals.

23–24 (group): High winds, acidic precipitation, or a drift of grey goo eats through the PCs’ shelter’s roof.

25–26: The character wakes to discover that some of their equipment has been pilfered, but the PC on watch didn’t see anything (and isn’t responsible for the theft). Investigation reveals that weirdly smart termites (level 4) working together made off with the item.

27–28 (group): Yellow mushrooms with black speckles (level 4) grow profusely in the area and ooze weirdly blood‑like fluid when brushed or trod upon, or simply as PCs pass by. The mushrooms are poisonous, inflicting 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if ingested, but they also grant PCs a one‑time asset on any knowledge tasks they attempt during the next ten hours.

29–30 (group): That buzzing noise that’s been getting louder and louder is revealed as a swarm of aggressive, stinging radioactive bees.

\* Radioactive bees, swarm: level 5; stings inflict 6 damage and, on failed Might defense roll, an allergic reaction dealing 1 Speed damage (ignores Armor) each minute until target is tended

31–32 (group): The PCs enter a region threatened by pockets of explosive gas (level 5), visible before they detonate as low‑lying banks of thin, yellowish mist. If agitated, a gas pocket detonates, inflicting 5 points of damage on everything in the area, or 2 points on PCs who succeed on a Speed defense roll.

33–34: The character trips or is thrown from their vehicle or mount by a jolt or similar accidental incident, risking a broken bone on a failed difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.

35–36 (group): A before‑times radio transmission is received, asking anyone, anywhere, for aid.

37–38 (group): Mosquitos the size of hummingbirds attack.

\* Mosquitos, giant, swarm: level 3; bite inflicts damage and, on failed Might defense roll, target contracts Nipah

39–40: The character steps in a bear trap left by other survivors. The PC takes 6 points of damage and is caught in a painful clamp until an ally succeeds on a difficulty 6 Might task to remove it.

41–42: The character stumbles over a decaying human corpse apparently killed by invasive fungus (level 3) eating through their brain.

43–44: The character ate something that didn’t agree with them, and becomes so afflicted with nausea that their tasks, attacks, and defense rolls are hindered by two steps for the next few hours.

45–46 (group): A mushroom cloud from a nuclear detonation blooms on the horizon. Are the PCs far enough away to survive? Maybe, if they find shelter pronto.

47–48: A mutated animal with unhealthy skin lesions and bulbous growths (with giant rat stats) scurries from the character’s backpack or other container when they stow or retrieve equipment. The animal runs off unless attacked, in which case it fights to the death.

49–50 (group): The PCs encounter a survivor claiming to be looking for a source of water that’s not radioactive. Maybe they’re telling the truth and could use some help. Or maybe they’re a spy from a nearby raider camp.

51–52: The thin trickle of water running through the ruins must be intermittently in contact with live electrical wires, as the character discovers when they take 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are stunned, losing their next turn.

53–54: A lurking rattlesnake bites the PC, then slithers off.

55–56 (group): When the PCs return to their camp or place of refuge, they find that someone else has stolen all their carefully hoarded stores and wrecked part of the camp.

57–58 (group): A pack of seven rabid dogs appears, growling and snarling.

\* Rabid dog: level 3, attacks as level 4; Armor 1

59–60: The character falls partly (or completely) through the rotting floor, trapping their foot until they succeed on a difficulty 4 Might roll, or dropping them to a lower floor (and separating them from the others).

61–62 (group): It’s hot outside today, due to a combination of aberrant weather conditions. PCs without some means of cooling themselves off suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute in the “heat dome” covering the region.

63–64 (group): Eroded earth and dead vegetation in the region create perfect conditions for a sandstorm, which blows through the area for several hours, reducing visibility to an immediate distance.

65–66 (group): An electromagnetic storm rips through the area, knocking out any electronic devices the PCs might have, and potentially threatening PCs without shelter with a lightning strike (level 7).

67–68: An automatic defense system comes back online as PCs pass, deploying a metal‑clad pop‑up turret (level 5). Each minute, it targets the character with a mini‑missile attack that inflicts 10 points of damage (or 3 points even with a successful Speed defense roll).

69–70 (group): A group of three to six zombies (or cannibals, if your game has no zombies) stumbles out of the hospital, bunker, or old military facility.

71–72: The character’s trusty weapon finally rusts through or otherwise breaks.

73–74 (group): Seeping gas (level 4) in the area causes the PCs to begin hallucinating. Each is certain the other is some kind of threat—such as a raider, a zombie, or something else dangerous—until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll on their turn to realize what’s going on.

75–76 (group): The characters are caught in a stampede of rewilded giraffes, elephants, buffalo, or other large animals. Each PC suffers 3 points of damage, descends one step on the damage track, and on a failed difficulty 3 Speed defense roll, is borne along for a while and separated from their allies.

77–78 (group): The heavy rain and lightning storm suddenly births a tornado. PCs must seek shelter or suffer 7 points of damage each round they are exposed. If a PC takes enough damage to descend three steps on the damage track, they are pulled up into the vortex and lost.

79–80: The character discovers they’ve started growing a sixth finger on their left hand. Why? Maybe due to their previous exposures to whatever mutagen exists in the world, or for a reason yet to be learned.

81–82 (group): A before‑times jet appears in the sky, engines spewing smoke, before it crashes close enough to deal 4 points of damage to PCs that fail a difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.

83–84 (group): It begins to hail ice chunks the size of golf balls, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on PCs without shelter. The event also knocks any exposed vehicles or shelter the PCs rely on one step down the object damage track.

85–86: The character steps on a plant that releases spores blinding them for about a minute.

87–88: The character walks through a hidden trip wire set by other survivors, causing an alarm to blare.

89–90 (group): A group of people (level 2) with glazed eyes appear with gifts of food. They want to introduce the PCs to their AI benefactor (or warlord, if your game has no AIs) via an old‑time communications device they have with them.

91–92: The character has been pushing too hard and they’re exhausted; they move down one step on the damage track until after their next ten‑hour recovery.

93–94: Through misadventure, the character falls from the vehicle or mount, and no one else immediately notices.

95–96: A mutant skunk with two heads (or regular skunk, if your game doesn’t feature mutations) sprays the character. The character’s pleasant social interaction tasks are hindered by two steps for two to five days.

97–98 (group): NPC survivors demand PCs pay a toll to pass, equal to enough food and water to sustain one person for five days.

99–00 (group): The PCs arrive, but apparently their directions were wrong, because they’re not where they wanted to go, but someplace completely different.

OPTIONAL RULES FOR SUPERHEROs

Power Shifts  
Power shifts are an optional rule in the Cypher System Rulebook that represent many of the exceptional things that superheroes can do, like throwing cars, blasting through brick walls, leaping onto speeding trains, and cobbling together interdimensional gateway devices in a few hours.

A typical superhero PC gets five power shifts. Power shifts are like permanent free levels of Effort that are always active. They don’t count toward a character’s maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following.

Accuracy: All attack rolls.

Dexterity: Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense.

Flight: The character can fly a short distance each round; each additional shift increases this speed (whether the flight comes from a power shift or a character ability) by one range category (long for two shifts, very long for three shifts).

Healing: One extra (one-action) recovery roll per day.

Increased Range: Increases the range of one ability or attack. A touch-range ability (such as Shock) increases to short range, a short-range ability increases to long range, and a long-range ability increases to very long range.

Intelligence: Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and crafting tasks.

Power: Effects of one specific character ability, including damage for that ability (+3 points) if appropriate, but not attack rolls with that ability.

Prodigy: Give up a lower-tier ability to get a higher-tier ability

Resilience: Might defense rolls and Armor (+1).

Savant: Two specific skills (other than attacks, defenses, or a special ability), such as history, perception, or persuasion.

Single Attack: Attack rolls and damage (+3 points) for one specific kind of attack, such as pistols, kicks, or Thrust.

Strength: All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing damage with melee or thrown attacks (+3 points), but not attack rolls.

For power shifts that affect tasks, each shift eases the task. Applying two shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying three shifts eases the task by three steps.

A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change (however, researching an experimental procedure to change a character’s power shifts could be the culmination of a character arc such as Uncover a Secret).

## PRODIGY POWER SHIFTS

Some superhero character concepts are about breaking the normal power level for a hero. In most cases, you can do this using power shifts. For example, if you want your strong hero to be really strong, put one or more power shifts into strength. If you want your archer character to be really good at shooting arrows, put a power shift into single attack (bows). If you want your speedster hero to be really fast, put a power shift into power (Fleet of Foot). And so on.

But what if you want your character to be a swashbuckling teleporter who blinks all over the battlefield? There’s no low-tier teleportation ability, so you can’t be a teleporter as a tier 1 character, and the character concept isn’t nearly as fun if you have to wait until tier 4 before you can learn a teleportation ability (like Short Teleportation).

This is where you can (with the GM’s approval) use a power shift for the prodigy option. Prodigy lets you give up one of your lower-tier abilities for a higher-tier ability

that matches your character concept. For example, if your swashbuckling teleporter is a Graceful Explorer who Fights With Panache, you could give up one of your tier 1 Explorer abilities (so you’d only have three instead of four) or give up your tier 1 focus ability, Fights With Panache, and instead select the tier 4 ability Short Teleportation.

Choosing prodigy as a power shift is an interesting trade-off for your character; you end up with a powerful ability that you couldn’t get otherwise, but at the cost of a power shift (which the other characters are probably using to add to their skills, damage, or defenses). Keep in mind that higher-tier abilities tend to cost more Pool points (especially because your Edge as a low-tier character is less than that of a higher-tier character), so you’ll weaken yourself if you use that ability often—which might be a good reason to allocate more points to that stat Pool, or assign a power shift to healing so you have more opportunities per day to recover Pool points.

Theoretically, you could put two power shifts in prodigy for the same ability, allowing you to select a high-tier ability. However, there are two reasons not to do this. First, those high-tier abilities usually have even higher costs, which limits how often you can use them. Second, if you start out with the best version of that ability, there’s no room to grow. It’s fun when your character impresses other superheroes by improving an ability, and it’s really handy when your nemesis supervillain underestimates you based on your old limitations. So unless the GM wants every superhero PC to start with one top-tier ability, give yourself room to grow and use prodigy only to get a mid-tier ability.

## GAINING MORE POWER SHIFTS  
Some GMs will want to allow PCs to increase their power shifts. Having a character spend 10 XP to do so would probably be appropriate. Other GMs will want to run superhero games with PCs of greater or lesser power (cosmic-level heroes or street-level heroes, perhaps). In such cases, the GM should grant the PCs more or fewer power shifts at the game’s start.

## POWER STUNTS  
A power stunt is pushing a superpower beyond its normal limits or using it to do something it normally can’t do. Examples:

• A lightning-blaster hero shooting their electricity farther than normal

• A fire-creating hero absorbing fire from a burning building

• A telepathic hero communicating with or understanding a machine

• A teleporter hero traveling to another dimension

• An illusionist hero negating an opponent’s invisibility

The Cypher System Rulebook explains modifying abilities on the fly, describing

a method of altering the range, area, or other aspects of an Intellect-based ability by spending more Intellect points. In a superhero game, these modifications aren’t limited to Intellect-based abilities—it’s reasonable that a strong hero could affect a larger area with Golem Stomp or an agile hero could disarm more than one opponent using Advantage to Disadvantage. The cost for making these changes works just like modifying an Intellect-based ability. The additional cost uses the same Pool as the ability’s normal cost; if an ability doesn’t have a cost, the GM should choose an appropriate ability for the points to come from.

• Increasing range costs 1 Pool point per range step increased (immediate to short, short to long, long to very long).

• Increasing duration costs 1 Pool point for one step (one minute to ten minutes, ten minutes to an hour). Durations cannot be increased more than one step in this way. Abilities that last for only an action or a round (such as an Onslaught attack) cannot have their duration increased.

Abilities that don’t have a Pool cost, like Eyes Adjusted, can be modified as well. If modifying the range or duration, the GM decides what Pool the point cost is paid from. However, most abilities like this don’t have ranges or durations, so modifying them requires a difficult, formidable, or impossible task roll.

Modifying the area or other aspects of an ability is more difficult. Instead

of increasing the Pool point cost, the character decides how they want to modify their ability, and the GM sets a difficulty of the task to successfully modify it, according to the following guidelines:

Difficult (4): Something within the spirit and general idea of the ability, using a self- only ability on another character, or using a single-target ability in a weakened form on two targets. Examples: Using a self-only ability like Hover to give another creature the power to fly. Using Teleportation to go to another dimension instead of somewhere in the same dimension. Splitting Frost Touch or Onslaught into hindered attacks against two opponents.

Formidable (7): Something similar to the description or intent of the ability, but changing its nature, or having a single-target ability affect an area. Examples: Using Hover to make an opponent crash into the ceiling. Using Shroud of Flame to absorb fire. Using Telepathic to talk to a machine or Machine Telepathy to talk to a living person.

Impossible (10): An effect that has nothing to do with the ability’s description or intent. Examples: Using Hover to blast an opponent with fire. Using Foil Danger to copy an opponent’s attack. Using an attack like Thunder Beam to heal someone.

Of course, if the altered ability is an attack, the hero still needs to make a successful attack roll against their target— just because the character found a way to use Hover as an attack doesn’t mean the attack automatically hits. The attack task for the altered ability uses the normal difficulty for attacking that target. For example, if Hammermind wants to split her Onslaught so she can attack two level 2 robots, first she has to succeed at the difficulty 4 task to split the attack, then she can make the two (hindered) level 2 attack rolls against the robots.

Just like in any aspect of the game, other factors might ease or hinder the hero’s attempt to perform the stunt. For example, if the hero Firelash is trying a stunt to use his Shroud of Flame to absorb a fire attack from his evil sister Swordblaze, the GM might decide that the similarities in their flame powers mean that Firelash’s attempt is eased. But if the illusionist hero Hologrim is trying a power stunt to reveal where his invisible archenemy Death Ghost is hiding, the GM might feel that the villain’s magical invisibility is especially difficult for Hologrim’s technology-based illusions to counter, so the hero’s task is hindered. The GM can also introduce power boost cyphers that ease the power stunt task, or present the heroes with temporary effects that ease or hinder power stunt tasks, like a virus that erratically amplifies mutant genes, or a burst of energy from an alien artifact that reacts with a robot hero’s power core.

If a hero tries a particular stunt in more than one session, the GM doesn’t need to give the task the same difficulty every time; the circumstances of each attempt are never quite the same. Perhaps this supervillain’s fire is a little hotter or cooler than the one the hero tried to absorb last time. Or the spaces between the dimensions are thinner or thicker right now, making it harder to teleport between them. The position of two opponents or the shape of a room might be different than the last time the hero tried splitting an attack power across multiple targets. In other words, the GM doesn’t have to remember that the last time the hero tried this stunt it was difficulty 7, so it has to be difficulty 7 this time; just look at the current circumstances and make a decision based on that. In fact, this is part of the reason why the difficulties are three levels apart; the GM is more likely to be consistent at rating something as difficult, formidable, or impossible than deciding whether it’s a level 6 or level 7 task.

## PERMANENT POWER STUNTS

Once a character has successfully performed the same difficult, formidable, or impossible power stunt a few times, they might want to make it a permanent part of their repertoire of abilities. By spending 2 XP, the character gains the ability to perform that power stunt whenever they want, with no need for a power stunt task. The GM decides how many times the character has to get the stunt right before they can spend XP to learn it. Three successful attempts over at least three separate sessions is a reasonable guideline, plus some downtime between game sessions to represent mastering this variant.

Learning a power stunt does not count as a step in character advancement.

Learning how to do a formidable or impossible power stunt might be the reason to take a character arc like New Discovery, Transformation, or Uncover a Secret.

## REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TASKS

The Cypher System Rulebook gives a few examples of how, in the superhero genre, having power shifts means that a difficulty 10 task is not impossible. Superheroes deal with planetary threats like giant robots, multidimensional sorcerers, and world-sized monsters, and for this sort of campaign, difficulties up to 15 are possible. This section presents more details and examples of tasks, threats, and creatures of difficulty 11 to 15.

## FEATS OF STRENGTH

Use the following table to estimate the difficulty of various incredible feats of physical strength.

| Difficulty | Lifting Task |
|----|----|
| 4 | Lift a 150-pound (68 kg) object |
| 9 | Lift a 400-pound (180 kg) object |
| 10 | Lift a 1-ton (1 tonne) car or traffic copter |
| 11 | Lift a 5-ton (4.5 tonne) ambulance, private jet, elephant, or Tyrannosaurus rex |
| 12 | Lift a 10-ton (9 tonne) school bus, combat helicopter, triceratops, or 5-foot boulder |
| 13 | Lift a 20-ton (18 tonne) fire truck, mobile home, fighter jet, Apatosaurus, or light military tank |
| 14 | Lift a 40-ton (36 tonne) humpback whale or loaded tractor-trailer |
| 15 | Lift an 80-ton (72 tonne) space shuttle, single-story house, passenger train car, or military tank |

| Task Circumstances | Difficulty  |
|----|----|
| Lifting the object as high as the character can reach | +0 |
| Lifting the object only partway off the ground | -1 |
| Asset (lever, jack, etc.) | -1 or -2 |
| Help from another character (asset) | -1 or -2 |
| Large character (double human size) | -1\* |
| Carrying an object an immediate distance | +0 |
| Carrying an object a short distance | +1 |
| Pushing or pulling (not lifting) an object an immediate distance | -1 |
| Pushing or pulling (not lifting) an object a short distance | +0 |
| Pushed or pulled object can roll or slide very easily | -1 |
| Pushed or pulled object is buoyant and moving through water | -1 |

\*Each additional doubling of the character’s size eases the task by another step.

Some character abilities are able to move heavy things, often more easily than brute physical strength can. If a superhero wants to push the limits of what those abilities can do, the GM can compare the baseline effects of those abilities to the Feats of Strength table to determine the comparable difficulty of the task, and modify the character’s roll to succeed.

## FEATS OF SPEED  
A character can move a short distance (50 feet \[15 m\]) as their entire action as a routine task (difficulty 0, no roll needed). This is basically a jog or a hustle, faster than a walk

but not an all-out run. A character can try to run a long distance (100 feet \[30 m\]) as their entire action, but they must succeed at a difficulty 4 Speed task to complete the movement; failure means they trip, stumble, slip, or fall down at some point during the move and stop.

Of course, superheroes aren’t normal people—they’re exceptional, and some can run as fast as Olympic athletes, or much faster. For a character trying to run more than a long distance as their entire action, use the following table to determine the difficulty for the task. Failing this roll is just like failing the basic running roll described above.

| Difficulty  | Running Distance   | Notes                                   |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 6           | 200 feet (60 m)    | 19 mph (30 kph)                         |
| 8           | 250 feet (76 m)    | 24 mph (39 kph); bear, Olympic sprinter |
| 9           | 340 feet (104 m)   | 33 mph (53 kph); cat, coyote, greyhound |
| 10          | 400 feet (120 m)   | 49 mph (79 kph); horse, tiger           |
| 11          | 700 feet (210 m)   | 68 mph (110 kph); cheetah               |
| 12          | 1,400 feet (430 m) | 136 mph (220 kph)                       |
| 13          | 2,800 feet (850 m) | 273 mph (440 kph)                       |
| 14          | 1 mile (1.5 km)    | 545 mph (880 kph); Boeing 747           |
| 15          | 2 miles (3 km)     | 1,600 mph (2,575 kph); Mach 2           |

## TREMENDOUS LEAPS

Some—but not all—strong superheroes can easily leap dozens or hundreds of feet, well beyond what’s possible with the jumping rules (running a short distance and jumping 30 feet \[9 m\] is a difficulty 10 task). Characters who want to jump huge distances like that should take the Amazing Leap ability, allowing them to jump a long distance or more.

All characters with at least one power shift in strength get the benefit of a free level of Effort for each strength shift. This effectively increases their standing jump distance by 1 foot (30 cm) per shift and their running jump distance by 2 feet (60 cm) per shift, which is impressive compared to a normal person, but not phenomenal.

To make superhero character jumps a bit more exciting, the GM can implement an optional rule in which strength shifts count double for free levels of Effort when jumping. For example, a character with five strength shifts would get ten free levels of Effort on jump tasks instead of five. This allows them to do a 15-foot (4.5 m) standing jump as a difficulty 1 task (base difficulty 11, eased by 5 × 2 steps) and a 40-foot (12 m) running jump as a difficulty 5 task (base difficulty 15, eased by 5 × 2 steps), which seems more appropriate for a character strong enough to lift a car over their head.

## MODIFYING HIGH-TECH DEVICES

It’s common for technically savvy superheroes to fiddle with machines to make them work better or do something different. Sometimes the object in question is their own gear, but it’s just as likely to be something they took from a defeated supervillain or found on an alien spaceship.

A character who expects to modify many devices should consider learning abilities such as Innovator, Jury-Rig, Modify Artifact Power, Modify Device, and Quick Work. A character who only wants to dabble in this sort of activity can do so, but it takes longer and is less efficient.

Small modifications are things like changing a device’s target, range, or duration. “Small” is subjective and up to the GM, but generally, it means adding another target (although for some high-level devices, adding a target isn’t a small change), increasing the range by one step (immediate to short, short to long, long to very long), or increasing the duration by one step (one minute to one hour, one hour to ten hours). The task difficulty for making a small modification is generally equal to the device’s level minus 1, which also determines how much time it takes to complete the modifications. 

Big changes are modifying a laser rifle to shoot cold or electricity, turning a communication device into a telepathic shield, or turning a jetpack into a force field device. These modifications are like repairs; they use the device’s level for the difficulty and creation time, but take half as long as the time listed. 

A character modifying their own device eases the task. This applies whether the character built the device themselves or they’ve been repairing and tinkering with it long enough that they fully understand its workings.

Regardless of whether the change is big or small, failing the modification task means the character wastes the full amount of time spent attempting the modification, and uses up materials equal to the device’s level minus 2, but they can try again. If they fail with a roll of a natural 1, it’s likely that the free GM intrusion means the device is ruined (but perhaps could be salvaged for materials).

Modification GM intrusions: The device gains a high depletion rate, needs to be recharged after each use, or develops a side effect such as overheating (inflicting damage to the user) or creating a thunderous noise.

Modifying a device is similar to using a power stunt to alter a character ability. If a character wants to make a permanent change to one of their technology-based abilities, the GM should treat that more like a permanent power stunt—costing XP—than a modification.

Modifying the appearance of an item is just a cosmetic change and should take only a few hours at most for a typical handheld or worn item like a weapon, helmet, or boots. Changing

the appearance of a spacesuit or full-body mechanized armor might take eight to twenty hours of work, depending on the extent of the changes.

## FASTER CRAFTING IN A HIGH-TECH SETTING  
In some superhero campaigns, crafting technology is so advanced that objects are designed virtually, with holograms, or with a mind-machine interface, and they are constructed by advanced 3D printers or clouds of nanobots. Under these conditions, the GM should ease

the assessed difficulty to determine the crafting time by three or four steps, with the crafter needing to be present for only about the first quarter of that time and the “helpers” taking care of the rest.

## OPTIONAL RULES FOR HORROR

This chapter describes many different optional rules (called “horror modules”) for making horror games more exciting or suspenseful. Horror modules are tweaks the GM applies

to the rules to make a horror scenario even more scary or to represent how

an event usually happens in a horror genre

If a module changes the options that players or PCs have, the GM should tell the players about it when the game begins. For example, if the GM is using the Character Posse module, the players should know about it at the start of the game so they can become familiar with all their characters instead of having to pause when they switch scenes and spend several minutes reviewing a second set of characters. Likewise, players should know if their healing options are affected by the Ironman module, or if they have additional recovery roll options from the Hysteria module.

This chapter also suggests various modules that are appropriate for different horror genres. The GM should feel free to use some, all, or none of those modules when running a game of that type, or introduce other modules to provide a unique twist to the game.

 GENERAL HORROR GM INTRUSIONS

The following GM intrusions work for most horror genres.

• Something foils a character’s attempt to escape: a getaway car won’t start, they drop the keys that unlock the exit door or lock up the villain, or the shotgun they’re using to clear a path jams or runs out of shells.

• The antagonist enters a secure or sealed room by an unexpected method: crashing through a door or wall, crawling out of a ventilation shaft, jumping out of a trap door, manifesting electronically through a Wi-Fi signal, or teleporting.

• A mysterious noise nearby amplifies the tension, and when investigated reveals itself to

be . . . a cat, either perfectly calm or hissing and leaping. This often allows for a momentary de-escalation followed by a real scare, such as the antagonist reaching out of the darkness to grab a character.

• A dramatic and/or ridiculous amount of blood and gore from something that just got killed splashes on a character, blinding them until they take an action to wipe their eyes clean.

## BAD PENNY

An unwanted or dangerous object (such as a cursed artifact) keeps turning up, no matter how many times the PCs try to discard or destroy it. In many cases, there might be only one way to rid themselves of the item (such as dousing it with holy water or burying it in a graveyard) or only one way to destroy it (such as burning it in a church or stabbing it with a magical dagger). The item might slowly repair itself—and depending on the item, it might be more frightening if it shows up fully intact or still bearing damage from how the PCs tried to destroy it.

This reappearance usually isn’t because the item is literally walking to wherever the PCs are (although if the item is something like a cursed doll, that might make it more frightening). In most cases, it just happens to be where the PCs went, found in an unobtrusive place like the back of a closet, under a car seat, or in the bottom of someone’s luggage. If the item is intelligent (or controlled by a hostile intelligence), it might use NPCs to bring it back to the PCs, and might sacrifice those NPCs in dramatic and gory ways to make sure it ends up back in the hands of the PCs. For example, if the PCs abandon a haunted ring, on the next day when they’re waiting for a train they recognize a man they saw earlier just as he gets hit by an oncoming train, and his severed hand—wearing the ring—lands at their feet. Even if the PCs go to a remote area with no people, one of them might suddenly vomit up their lunch—and the haunted ring.

## CHARACTER POSSE

Every player is given at least two characters to run, each with about the same amount of background and abilities so they’re all suitable as main characters. A player usually runs only one of these PCs at a time. As the action in the story changes locations, the GM can have one or more players switch their active PC and interact with the other active PCs and the story in

a different way. This keeps the players from knowing which characters are supposed to have the important roles in the story, allows for some of the PCs to split off for a while without the rest

of the group having to wait, and gives every player a backup character to play if their active PC dies.

Character Posse works best when the characters are very simple and don’t have many abilities that require a lot of knowledge and description. That way the player can focus on the personality of the PC and not have to keep remembering a stack of complicated abilities. In a non-fantastic modern setting, that often means characters who have a lot of skills and automatic or simple bonuses (like Combat Prowess and Fleet of Foot) but one or zero abilities that have durations or require special actions (like Anecdote and Muscles of Iron).

## DEAD ALL ALONG  
A handful of people are forced to stick together under unusual circumstances—they’re survivors of a shipwreck, quarantined to avoid an outbreak of a deadly disease, waiting for a riot to leave their neighborhood, or locked away from an approaching zombie horde. They hear strange noises, glimpse shadowy figures, and find that things move about or disappear when nobody is looking. The PCs begin to suspect they’re being haunted by ghosts or observed by mysterious aliens; one or more of them disappear or are found dead. Eventually the PCs realize that they are ghosts of people who haven’t come to terms with their own deaths, and the weird experiences are their limited interactions with the real world and the living people trying to bury their bodies or put their souls at peace.

In these stories, the emotional journey of the ghosts is about understanding their situation and coming to terms with their deaths. In normal play, GM intrusions are complications that the characters have to deal with, but to represent the secret and inverted expectation of this module, GM intrusions are used to simplify what the characters experience, but with a spooky twist.

When a PC crosses over and disappears, that player can still participate in the game by using the Ghostly Helpers module.

FRAGILITY 

Whenever a character selects the Increasing Capabilities option for advancement or gains an ability that permanently increases their Pools, they can add a maximum of 1 point to their Might Pool and 1 point to their Speed Pool; other points left over (if any)

must go to their Intellect Pool, even if that’s not normally an option for the ability. This does not apply to the extra points the player can divide among their Pools at character creation. This creates a more “realistic” game scenario where the PCs are more like normal people who don’t get much more powerful physically over the course of a campaign, but still can learn new skills, advance their minds, and so on.

This module does not affect abilities like Enlarge (which temporarily adds 4 points to your Might Pool), but it does affect abilities like Enhanced Might, Enhanced Speed, and Lead From the Front (which permanently increase one or more Pools).

GHOSTLY HELPERS 

In a horror story, it’s common for major characters to be killed or incapacitated, but in a horror RPG, that means the player of a dead character doesn’t have much to do. The Ghostly Helpers module gives players whose characters are out of the game two ways to have an active role in the scenario.

First, the dead character is still able to spend their XP to give a living character a reroll. To facilitate this, the GM should allow players to award the second 1

XP from a GM intrusion to a dead character (although this would come up only if there is one character left alive and the second XP would be wasted) and give dead characters 1 XP whenever there is a group intrusion.

Second, the dead character is able to use their subtle cyphers to help a living character. Depending on the cypher, this might be a direct benefit to the PC (like easing a roll) or interfering with an NPC (like making an opponent drop their weapon). When the GM gives out more subtle cyphers, any excess ones (beyond the cypher limit of living PCs) should go to the dead characters, up to the cypher limits of the dead characters (any extra cyphers beyond that are lost).

The player of a dead character always gets to decide when to help and which PC to affect with their help—they’re not merely extensions of the living PCs. Whether this help is just fate or coincidence working on behalf of the PC, or if it literally is the lingering ghost of a dead character trying to save a living person, depends on the scenario and the GM.

Help from a dead character doesn’t have to be from a ghost. Depending on the genre, it might be the influence of a guilty artificial intelligence, a sentient weapon with a grudge, a cultist with conflicting loyalties, and so on

## HALLUCINATION RESET

In some horror genres, it’s unclear if the character is truly experiencing what’s happening in the story, or if they’re hallucinating or dreaming it. In some cases, their fear response

to the real events happening around them prompts their conscious or subconscious imagination to create an unreal scenario that’s even more terrifying, only to have them snap out of it and find themselves in a prior (but perhaps still very dangerous) situation. This sort of hallucination allows the story to go completely off the rails and then suddenly return to normal.

If the GM plans to have a hallucination reset, they should keep track of damage taken, equipment used, and XP spent for each character (if using cypher and XP cards, there should be a separate space for each character’s used cards). When the hallucination ends, stop the action, explain that the PCs find themselves at an earlier point in the story (or wake up after some time has passed if it’s a dream), and restore their Pools, equipment, and XP to their previous state. If the GM doesn’t know exactly how much each character’s Pool changed, allow each PC to make a free recovery roll to compensate for it.

If the GM needs to use a hallucination reset to recover from a disastrous outcome, they should   try to reset the PCs as close as possible to their previous state, relying on the players’ recollection of which cyphers and XP belonged to each character. As it’s unlikely that they kept track of how many Pool points they spent in the now-false encounters, the GM can allow each of them a free recovery roll to make up for it.

Used carefully, a hallucination reset leaves the characters wondering what is real, and it can be a tool for the GM to rewind an encounter that goes out of control or accidentally kills a character because of poor rolls. Used too much, it risks causing the players to lose interest in the game because the frequent resets undermine their emotional connections to their characters and negate any progress in the story.

Note that a deliberate and planned reset can deliberately do strange things with the story because it’s completely in the characters’ heads. A horror game about werewolves might have a dream or hallucination about fascist soldiers attacking the PCs with flamethrowers. One about aliens might show the antagonists turning into sexy vampires. A haunted house might convince the PCs that they’re tearing off their own faces. A hallucination might even include elements of something that will happen in the future, so when the actual event occurs (perhaps in a later session) the players won’t know if they should act on their “future memories” of these events or ignore them as falsehoods.

## HORROR MODE

Horror Mode is an optional rule discussed in the Cypher System Rulebook. When using this rule, the GM can escalate the tension by increasing the range of numbers that trigger a GM intrusion: first on a roll of 1 or 2 instead of 1, then a roll of 1 to 3, then a roll of

1 to 4, and so on. The Escalation Rate table below shows what causes the intrusion range to increase.

Horror Mode is unique among the horror modules in that the default assumption is that the GM is using it for every horror game, at least some of the time. Using Horror Mode makes the players aware of the risks they take every time they make a roll. They won’t take easy tasks for granted, and they might apply Effort to turn an easy task into a routine task so they don’t have to roll at all and risk an intrusion. This ends up depleting their Pools faster, which makes them feel more vulnerable.

## HYSTERIA

Screaming is a natural reaction when you’re frightened, but it’s also likely

to draw the attention of whatever is frightening you. The Hysteria horror module encourages characters to give in to the natural instinct to scream, but introduces dangerous consequences for doing so.

At any time, as an action, a PC can use a free one-action recovery roll (which doesn’t use up the one-action recovery roll that all characters get), but doing so means they also spend that action loudly screaming. Because of this noise, the GM can make a free intrusion and doesn’t have to award XP for it.

A PC’s ten-minute recovery roll takes only one minute, but the PC

has to scream and have an emotional meltdown for the entire time. As with the previous option, this allows the GM to make a free intrusion (after the recovery period) and they don’t have

to award XP for it. The PC still has the option of resting normally for ten minutes to use the ten-minute recovery roll (without screaming, and without the free intrusion).

In most situations that use Hysteria, the free intrusions involve drawing the

attention of something that wants to harm the PCs or the sudden appearance of something dangerous.

## INSTANT PANIC

Most people in real life aren’t prepared for the existence of aliens, monsters, or killer robots, and seeing something that shatters their worldview is frightening and traumatic. The first time a character sees a creature (or anything else suitably horrifying) they thought wasn’t possible or only existed in books and movies, they must make an Intellect defense roll against the creature’s level. If they fail, for one round either they’re paralyzed with fear or they run in the opposite direction.

Repeat appearances by the creature (or other creatures like it) that they’ve seen before usually don’t trigger this reaction a second time, but encountering a large number of those creatures or seeing them do something unusual might trigger it. For example, seeing a ghoul crawl out of a storm drain might trigger panic; seeing another ghoul (or the same one again) won’t trigger it again, but seeing a large pack of ghouls approaching, or seeing one ghoul eating a dead person could trigger another panic reaction. Even if a character has gotten over their initial panic, the GM can prompt it again as an intrusion if the circumstances warrant it.

## IRONMAN

There are no cyphers (subtle or manifest) or artifacts that heal, and all other healing effects (such as recovery rolls and Healing Touch) restore only the minimum amount possible. For example, a tier 2 character using a recovery roll would get only 3 points (as if they rolled a 1 on a d6, plus 2 for their tier) to add to their Pools. This results in a gritty, dire scenario where the only way PCs can restore their Pools is with recovery rolls and character abilities that heal.

Cypher System characters are tough and resilient, even at tier 1, but Ironman brings them down to a more realistic power level. Ironman is more punitive for characters whose abilities cost Pool points and less of a challenge for characters whose abilities don’t cost anything (such as Physical Skills). For a slightly less challenging option, allow the use of healing cyphers and artifacts, but limit them to the minimum amount.

## LAST SURVIVOR

Sometimes the antagonist kills off all the protagonists one by one, leaving only one survivor to challenge them. In the journey toward that point, it’s not clear who the last survivor will be, and sometimes a potential last survivor is eliminated unexpectedly or sacrifices themselves so that another person may live. The Last Survivor horror module

is a way for PCs to temporarily thwart fate, but it inevitably feeds toward the last surviving character having extra advantages when dealing with the murderous antagonist.

When using this module, the GM places a token on the game table that represents the last survivor, and puts a piece of paper (or an XP card) underneath the token that represents 1 XP. Whenever there is a GM intrusion, instead of giving 2 XP to a player and letting that player award 1 XP to another player, the GM gives 1 XP to the chosen player, and the other 1 XP is added to the last survivor token. Whenever there is a group intrusion, 1 XP is added to the last survivor token (as if the last survivor were a separate PC).

At any time, a player can decide that their PC becomes the last survivor by picking up the token and its XP.

However, those XP belong to the role of the last survivor and always remain separate from individual character XP. While a PC is the last survivor, they gain the following benefits and restrictions:

• All rolls to save them from being killed are eased by two steps.

• The last survivor XP can be spent only by the last survivor, and only on the last survivor’s rolls, never on any other players’ rolls. (The PC can still spend their personal XP normally, including on other players’ rolls.)

• At any time, whoever has the token can pass the role of last survivor to another player. The receiving player gets all the XP associated with the last survivor (if there are none, the GM immediately gives 1 XP to the token).

• Once a player has given up the role of last survivor, they can never again be the last survivor.

• If the last survivor role has no XP left to spend, and there are no other players to pass the token to (because everyone else has already been the last survivor), the last survivor can pass the token to the GM in exchange for their character getting 1 XP. Once this happens, the last survivor token is removed from the game.

## MADNESS

Madness is an optional rule discussed in the Cypher System Rulebook. When using this rule, if Intellect damage from fear or shock reduces a PC’s Intellect Pool to 0, they regain points in the Pool, but their maximum Intellect Pool is reduced by 1. If their Intellect Pool is ever reduced to 0 again, they go insane and replace their current descriptor with the Mad descriptor.

## PERILOUS VENTURE  
Sometimes the PCs need to perform a ritual or other complex action that takes several rounds or minutes, and if they make mistakes along the way it’s a setback instead of an outright failure. For example, they might need to read a banishing spell out of an old book, mix and heat the chemicals for a zombie cure, or draw a magic circle around a building to contain hostile ghosts. Rather than having their success or failure come down to one roll, the GM can build tension by requiring the players to make multiple rolls called subtasks. The subtasks start at difficulty 1, and the difficulty increases each time until the players make a final roll at the highest difficulty (equal to the overall level of the challenge, such as the demon they want to banish, the original zombie virus, or the most powerful ghost attempting to leave the house).

Generally, these subtasks occur at equally divided intervals over the course of the full time required to complete the ritual. If at any point the PC fails a subtask, the ritual isn’t ruined, but it costs time—a failure means the time spent on that subtask was wasted, but the character can spend that much time again and try to succeed at that same subtask.

Skills, assets, and other special abilities can ease subtasks just like they do with any other task (which might make some of the subtasks routine and not require a roll at all). Characters may apply Effort to each subtask. Of course, applying Effort is something characters do in the moment, not over long periods of time, so it’s generally impossible to apply sustained Effort on a task or subtask that takes longer than a day.

The GM should decide if a given ritual is something that other PCs can help with. Even if it initially seems like a solo venture (like reading a spell from a book), it might benefit from assistants who repeat a chant, burn candles, perform arcane gestures, or just hold the acting character upright as the ritual drains their strength. In general, giving multiple PCs something to do is better than having everyone wait on the sidelines while one character holds the spotlight.

To make the situation more interesting, the GM can introduce a time challenge, like requiring the PCs to finish by a specific time (perhaps a midnight deadline for containing the ghosts in the house, or banishing a demon that’s inflicting damage to an NPC every round it possesses them). This puts pressure on the PCs to complete the process as soon as possible.

The GM can also add side effects for failed rolls or as intrusions. For example, a weak spot in the salt line might allow one powerful ghost to break free, an error in the banishing spell might painfully enrage the demon and hinder the next subtask, electrical or magical energy might lash out and harm a nearby character, and so on. The ritual might use up quantities of

a limited resource, such as holy water, silver powder, or rare herbs; if the PCs have only enough materials to complete the ritual (perhaps with a little extra in case they make one mistake), that forces them to use Effort, XP, and other tricks to make sure they don’t fail too often and run out.

Finally, some rituals might require the PCs to spend points from their Pools on each subtask, with Might representing blood or vitality, Speed representing energy, and Intellect representing will or sanity. Other physical or mental tolls could also require points from Pools. Multiple PCs involved in the ritual could collectively contribute to this cost.

## POOR CHOICES  
Sometimes people in horror do dumb things. They wander off alone to investigate a weird noise. They abandon their friends and try to escape in a rusty old car. They have sex in a spooky barn. These things usually put them in danger and sometimes get them gruesomely killed. Using the Poor Choices module means the GM can use intrusions to make the characters do things that the audience of a horror movie would think are stupid.

These intrusions work like the normal kind (the GM awards 2 XP, and the player gives one of them to another player). However, while normal intrusions are subtle changes that influence the situation, using Poor Choices lets the GM abandon that restraint and dictate a specific overt character action, even if it’s something that the player wouldn’t normally choose.

These intrusions can be risky, but they shouldn’t be obviously self-destructive or harmful. For example, the GM shouldn’t use an intrusion to make a PC drink something that they know is poisonous, jump out of an airplane without a parachute, punch a police officer, or stare directly at an eclipse. The idea is to put the character in a complicated situation more forcefully than the player might choose, but not set up the character for failure. The players know they’re in a horror scenario, but their characters don’t, and this helps prevent the players from using metagame knowledge to keep the PCs out of trouble. Another way to look at it is the characters should act as if they live in a world where horror movies don’t exist, so they don’t know not to do these things.

As with any GM intrusion, the player can choose to spend 1 XP to refuse a Poor Choices intrusion, but they should consider accepting the intrusion for the sake of the story, and because they’ll need the XP later.

## POOR CHOICES INTRUSIONS

The following are examples of GM intrusions to use with the Poor Choices module.

A character investigates a strange noise on their own. (“It’ll be fine!”)

• Two or more characters sneak off to have sex.

• A character leaves behind an important piece of equipment, such as a weapon, phone, car keys, or their outer layer of clothes. (The GM can use this intrusion after the fact when a player tries to use a specific item.)

• A character gets drunk or high.

• A character falls asleep.

• A character slips away to urinate out in the woods or a nearby scary building.

• A character doesn’t care that nearby animals are acting strange (especially if they’re guard dogs).

• A character doesn’t shoot a dead monster in the head. (“We need to save ammo.”)

• A character runs away into the dark or away from a place that would be a better, safer direction to run.

• A character reads aloud words from the weird old book they found, or they play an old recording of someone else reading the book aloud.

• In a multistory building, a character runs upstairs or down into a basement (where they could get cornered) instead of outside where they could escape in any direction.

• A character chooses a dumb or obvious hiding place, such as a closet or under a bed.

• A character tries to escape by squeezing through a space that no human could reasonably get through quickly, such as a doggie door or a tiny window in a garage door.

• A character hides the fact that they’ve been bitten by a zombie, have a weird rash like the one they saw on the walls of the alien spaceship, or have been hearing a spooky voice telling them to kill their friends. (“I’ll be okay.”)

• A character runs straight down the road to get away from a pursuing vehicle (instead of onto the sidewalk, behind a big tree, or around a tight corner).

• A prone or supine character crawls away from approaching danger instead of getting up and running.

• A character doesn’t call the local authorities for help when they hear something dangerous.

• A character ignores or rationalizes a weird noise. 

• A character jumps into the water—a lake, swimming pool, sacred fountain, and so on.

• A character goes into the cave, mine shaft, or creepy house. (“I’m just going to look around for a second.”)

• A character insists on staying behind while everyone else goes on ahead. (“Someone should be here when the sheriff shows up!”)

• A character doesn’t check the back seat of a car before getting in and starting it.

• A character ignores an obvious creepy clue that there’s something wrong in the house, like a bloody axe, a room full of taxidermy animal heads, or newspaper clippings about recent murders.

• While being pursued, a character calls for help or otherwise attracts attention (like banging on store windows at midnight).

• A character tries to pet an unknown lifeform.

• A character tries to make peaceful contact with an obviously hostile entity. (“It’s as frightened of us as we are of it!”)

• A character unlocks a door or disables a security system to let a scared stranger into a safe area. 

• A character doesn’t bother to turn on the lights. 

• A character uses an action taunting their foe.

• A character follows a trail of blood.

• A character ignores good advice from a helpful and knowledgeable NPC. (“That old lady was a superstitious kook.”)

• A character uses a firearm as a loud, ineffective solution for a simple problem (like shooting a padlock).

• A character picks up a shady or outright scary-looking hitchhiker.

• A character scares another character (perhaps by grabbing their shoulder unexpectedly and shouting) as a joke.

• A character momentarily forgets how to do a simple action, like open or close a door.

• A character forgets to put their phone on silent mode. 

• A character imitates or makes fun of a creepy doll or statue.

• A character tries to help a child who has no reason for being there.

POSSESSION 

Some demons have the ability to possess a living creature, taking over a character’s body as if it were the demon’s own. The demon must touch the character to attempt possession (even if the demon’s touch normally inflicts damage, the possession attempt doesn’t inflict damage). The character must make an Intellect defense roll or become possessed, whereupon the demon’s immaterial form disappears into the character.

The first round in which a character is possessed, they can act normally. In the second and all subsequent rounds, the possessing demon can try to control the actions of the host, but the character can attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested action. Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for one round. When the demon isn’t trying to control its host, the character can act as they choose. A possessing demon’s actions are limited to controlling its host and leaving the host (the demon can’t use its own abilities while in someone else’s body).

While it possesses another creature, the demon is immune to most attacks (though not so the host; killing the host will eject the demon).

A possessed character is allowed an Intellect defense roll once per day to try to eject the demon. The roll is hindered by one additional step each day of possession after the first seven days. An ejected, cast-out, or exorcised demon is powerless for one or more days. One way to exorcise a demon is to command it out in the name of an entity that has power over the demon. This can be attempted once per day and grants the possessed character an additional Intellect defense roll to eject the demon.

Other kinds of creatures (ghosts, beings of pure mental energy, and so on) may have the ability to possess characters in the same way that demons do.

## SECRET TWIST

It’s common when tensions are high and lives are on the line that humans get paranoid and start to turn on each other, interpreting stressed behavior as suspicious and seeing enemies in the eyes of strangers. This is compounded when there is an active threat that can disguise itself as human (like an alien or demon) or take off a mask and pretend to be a fellow prisoner or victim (like a chainsaw killer), only to reveal themselves when the perfect opportunity comes along. These secret twists are the source of many jump scares and unexpected betrayals that create chaos and paranoia.

To use a secret twist, the GM first needs to decide three things:

• The secrets they want the PCs to keep from each other. Examples might be “Your character is actually the shapechanging alien that is hunting everyone on the spaceship,” “The chainsaw killer is the identical twin of your character,” or “Another PC ruined your life but they don’t realize who you are.”

• The best time to reveal the secret to the player involved. This might be something the player learns before the game starts or a revelation during the game. If there are multiple secrets, the players might learn them at different times. For example, the PC whose life was ruined by another character might know this at the start of the game, but another PC might not know they had an identical twin (perhaps they were separated at birth).

• The best time to reveal the secret to the other characters. The GM might choose to push it out into the open (perhaps with a GM intrusion) or let the player decide when to reveal it. For example, the GM decides that walking into a dark room with a black light is how all the human PCs realize that one character is really a shapeshifting alien with UV-fluorescing skin, but the GM allows the PC whose family fortune was stolen by another character to bring that up on their own (perhaps when they’re alone with the thief).

If revealing the secret to the players is supposed to happen during the game, it would be suspicious if only one player was pulled aside for a conversation about it—the other players would know something unusual was going on. Instead, the GM can call a quick break in the game and send that player a text. Even better, the GM could send every player a secret text so that nobody is singled out by having to read a text. Alternatively, the GM can give a physical note to every player (perhaps using the secret twist Special Cards); some of these notes might be secrets and some innocuous, but the fact that everyone gets a note disguises who might be getting a secret twist. By making sure that each note has some kind of value (such as by letting a player trade it in later for an asset or a subtle cypher), players who don’t receive a special secret still spend a reasonable amount of time reading the note and keeping it safe.

If the players are especially skilled at roleplaying, there may be opportunities for multiple secret twists, especially those that change a character’s identity. For example, in a scenario where there are duplicates of the PCs walking around in their city (evil twins, clones, aliens, or the like), the identity of individual characters might switch from the originals to duplicates and back again several times during the game.

Multiple shifts of identity are probably easier for the GM and players to handle if they take place over several game sessions and each session starts with players knowing exactly who they’re playing. It also helps if the players take separate notes about what the original and the duplicate know.

## SHOCK

Shock is an optional rule discussed in the Cypher System Rulebook. When using this rule, seeing something terrifying means a PC must make an Intellect defense roll. The difficulty is based on the level of the scary thing, or the GM can simply choose the level (see the Shock Levels table). Failure on the defense roll means either the character takes Intellect damage or

the player temporarily loses control of the character (the GM decides if they scream, freeze, run, or take some other appropriate action, perhaps with input from the player).

SHOCK LEVELS 

| Event | Level |
|----|----|
| Something unexpected darts or jumps out | 1 |
| Something suddenly moves just out of the corner of the eye | 2 |
| A sudden loud noise (like a scream) | 2 |
| Unexpectedly seeing a corpse | 2 |
| Watching someone die | 3 |
| Seeing something impossible (like an inanimate object sliding across the floor) | 4 |
| Watching a friend die | 5 |
| Seeing a monstrous creature | Creature Level |
| Witnessing something supernatural (like a spell) | 5 |
| Seeing something mind-bending (like an impossible, multidimensional demigod coalescing out of thin air) | 8 |

## UNEASE

Horror isn’t always overt monstrosities trying to tear your limbs off or drag your soul into Hell. Sometimes it’s something slightly off-putting, a stretching of the norm, an itching behind your eyes, or a sinking feeling in your stomach. You can feel that something is wrong, but you don’t know exactly what, and you’re not sure what to do about it. Your body isn’t sure if it should jump into fight or flight, so you’re anticipating a spike of adrenaline and it’s very distracting.

With the Unease horror module, whenever a character is in the presence of something disturbing that risks breaking their worldview, all their actions are hindered. Normally this happens whenever the triggering situation is within a short distance of the character, but the range might vary depending on what the PC sees and the nature of the disturbance. For example, a demon the size of a house might cause unease whenever it’s within very long range, but a city-sized alien starship hovering in the sky might affect people whenever they can see it even though it’s a thousand miles away.

If the GM plans to have an ongoing Unease effect throughout an entire game session (like an alien death fleet), they should consider using physical reminders in the game area so players don’t forget its effects. Over time, the GM might allow characters to become used to these worrying sights, perhaps due to exposure or maybe by purchasing the familiarity as a medium-term benefit.

Some creatures in the Cypher System already have the ability to make others uncomfortable just by being in the same area, so if they are the only weird creatures the GM plans to use in a horror game, there’s no need for the Unease module.

In some ways, Unease is a more limited form of Instant Panic but can also be used in tandem with it.

## OPTIONAL RULES FOR FAIRYTALE

Fairy tale games have unique opportunities for magic that aren’t found elsewhere— death, curses, blessings, and wishes are all prevalent in fairy tales and make interesting elements in games. Here are some suggested ways to handle them.

Death

You’ve probably noticed that in fairy tales, characters die all the time. Or almost die. Or sleep forever instead of die. Or die and come back to life. You get the idea.

Potentially, this will also be true in a fairy tale game. Thankfully, death doesn’t have to be the end of a character’s life. There are any number of ways to stop or reverse death, including artifacts, cyphers, and abilities. Additionally, a few NPCs, such as witches or Death themself, may have the power to bring someone back from the dead.

Typically, though, if a character dies and chooses to stay dead (or is unable to find a way to return to life), they are dead—they no longer have bodies, abilities, Pools,

and so on. They can communicate to the living only through magic. Someone may stay dead for up to about a year (in game time) and still return to life. After that time elapses, death is permanent.

Curses

In fairy tale games, curses are likely to be common. Most witches can cast curses

of one form or another, as can many fey beings, queens, and sea creatures. Even objects and places can cause a character to become cursed. Characters might have multiple curses on them at the same time.

All curses have a level, from 1 to 10. The level affects how hard it is to resist the curse, as well as how severe the effects are and how difficult it is to remove the curse.

Curses work slightly differently than regular damage. Curses can have an impact on the game and the game mechanics (a character is turned into a fish or becomes invisible, all of their interactions are hindered, they take ongoing damage, and so on), or they can have more of a roleplaying impact (a character looks much older, they forget the word “apple,” their skin turns golden). See the Curse table for a list of example curses.

Preventing Curses 

When a character attempts to resist being cursed, they must make an Intellect defense roll against the level of the curse being cast. Being trained in Intellect defense eases

this task, as does having a skill in curses or resisting curses.

Often, part of a curse’s effects is hindering curse resistance; thus, a character who already has one curse on them will find defending against a second curse is more difficult (their task is hindered).

Removing Curses 

Similar to poison and disease, curses aren’t automatically removed when a character makes a regular recovery roll. Instead, they stick around, continuing to affect the PC long after the curse is cast. In order to rid themselves of a curse, the character must take actions to remove it. The actions required depend on the nature and level of the curse.

The easiest way to remove a curse is to find, buy, steal, borrow, or otherwise acquire an object that removes curses (such as the blood pearl blossom cypher). Alternatively, the character might be able to pay someone who is skilled in curse removal to do the deed.

Curse Intrusions and Curse Mode 

In addition to dealing with the original effect of the curse, a cursed character is more likely to have bad things happen to them. There are two ways for the GM to work this into the game: curse intrusions and Curse Mode. Ideally, you’ll want to use both of these, as they each add something unique to the experience of being cursed.

Curse intrusions work like regular GM intrusions, and the cursed character gets XP. However, they only get 1 XP instead of the usual 2, and they must decide whether to keep it or give it to another player. Introduce additional curse intrusions from the Curse Intrusions table when it feels appropriate. This might be anytime the character has a big success, when they’re in a particularly risky position, or when they start to feel like they’ve forgotten about the curse.

Curse Mode. When using this rule, the GM increases the range of numbers that trigger a GM intrusion. As soon as a character is cursed, every time they roll a 1 or a 2 (instead of just a 1), they trigger a GM intrusion. As time passes, GM intrusions happen on a roll of 1 to 3, then a roll of 1 to 4, and so on. This potentially means that a die roll in Curse Mode can indicate success i a task and still trigger a GM intrusion. Curse Mode is similar to the Horror Mode optional rule in the Cypher System Rulebook, with one exception: the escalation works at a much slower pace. This is because Curse Mode is not designed to heighten immediate tension, but rather to create a long-term sense of being saddled with an unwanted and unpredictable negative effect.

Typically, the intrusion range is increased by 1 when:

• The character is cursed.

• The character starts a new day (or makes their ten-hour recovery roll).

> • The character actively takes an action to remove the curse (curses like wreaking havoc, which is part of the reason they’re so hard to get rid of).

• The character attempts to resist an additional curse being cast upon them.

Once all curses are removed, Curse Mode is no longer in effect.

While not all regular GM intrusions are necessarily bad for the character, curse intrusions always make the cursed PC’s situation worse.

Curse Intrusions 

| d6 | Curse |
|----|----|
| 1 | An insect stings or bites the character at just the wrong moment. |
| 2 | Something in the area makes the character sneeze loudly and repeatedly. |
| 3 | The character shimmers in and out of view. |
| 4 | A deep sense of despair comes over the character. |
| 5 | The character feels an overwhelming urge to start dancing. |
| 6 | The character’s clothes are suddenly much too large. |

Curse Table 

Roll 1d20 on the Curse table to determine the effect of the curse, or choose one that feels appropriate to the situation and the characters.

Typically, curses that have simple roleplaying effects (such as the character’s inability to speak their own name) are lower-level curses, while those that affect gameplay (such as decreasing recovery roll points) are higher level. Curses that have multiple effects are likely the highest level of all. However, sometimes an incredibly simple curse is still very high level because the caster wants to make it very hard to get rid of.

| D20  | Effect                                                           |

Curse Removal Table 

Some curses have a specific way that they must be removed. Others can be removed in a variety of ways. You can use the table as a reference for ways to remove or undo a curse, or you can roll 1d10 to give a curse a specific method of removal.

There are also many artifacts, cyphers, and other objects in the world that will remove (or prevent) curses.

| 3 | Make things right (return the stolen item, apologize, or undo whatever was done to cause the curse to happen in the first place). |
| 4 | Write the name of the curse on a scrap of paper, bind it in a cloth with an egg, bury it at a crossroads, and never look back.  |
| 5 | Pass the curse to someone else (this typically requires learning how the curse was done and then passing it to another person in the same way, but there are also more creative ways to make this happen). |

Blessings 

When someone is blessed, it typically means that they are more likely to receive a beneficial GM intrusion when they roll a 1 (or when the GM deems it appropriate to give them an intrusion). The Blessing Intrusions table provides examples of positive GM intrusions that a blessed character might receive.

Blessing Intrusions 

| d6  | Blessing                                                           |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Someone randomly gives the character a small gift.                 |
| 2   | When the character speaks, gold coins fall from their mouth.       |
| 3   | A necessary item, map, or clue falls into the character’s lap.     |
| 4   | The weather is suddenly in the character’s favor.                  |
| 5   | Someone nearby just happens to have the thing the character needs. |
| 6   | A cypher or artifact works even better than expected.              |

Wishes 

Wishes can be granted via objects, creatures such as genies, or as part of a bargain. When the character asks for a wish, the GM assigns it a level. The larger and more difficult the wish, the higher the level. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7.

In order for a wish to be granted, the character must succeed on an Intellect-related task (usually persuasion or possibly intimidation) equal to the wish’s level. On a failed roll, the wish is either not granted at all or is partially granted, depending on the wish and the creature or object that is granting it.

Even if a wish is granted, the character may not get exactly what they want, especially if the wish is poorly worded, has multiple interpretations, or asks for something that is utterly impossible (such as destroying the entire world).

Optional Rule: I Have That!

In fairy tales, characters often have exactly the right mundane piece of equipment

that they need to bypass a story-related obstacle hidden away in a pocket or a bag. Rather than having the PCs stock up on mundane items like marbles, rope, and breadcrumbs in town, use the I Have That! rule. This means players don’t have to keep exact track of their characters’ mundane equipment; instead, they spend an amount to get an unspecified “Pocket Item” in

that category. Then, when they’re out in the world and realize they could solve a problem with an item, they can just say, “I have that!” and pull it from their pocket. All Pocket Items are one-use only; after using them, the PC marks off one of their Pocket Items for the appropriate price category.

Most Pocket Items are inexpensive, but moderate and expensive Pocket Items exist, and are likely more useful than their less expensive counterparts.

The GM has veto power over items that they don’t think you could have found or carried.

Using the I Have That! rule doesn’t preclude PCs from also purchasing these items directly. For example, if a character who sews wants to buy a thimble and an inexpensive Pocket Item, they can. However, they cannot later turn the thimble into a Pocket Item; it remains a thimble.

## GM INTRUSIONS

GM intrusions present fantastic opportunities to imbue fairy tale games with a bit more weirdness, wonder, and whimsy, all while making the game more interesting and surprising for characters.

There’s a list of example GM intrusions in the Cypher System Rulebook, and any of those would work in a fairy tale game. The GM intrusions included in this section are more specifically designed with fairy tale magic in mind—they’re what could happen when magic goes wrong (or extraordinarily right).

Remember that GM intrusions don’t always mean that something has gone wrong or is bad for the players (unless they are curse intrusions). A GM intrusion could be the arrival of a good omen, the sudden reversal of a curse, or something that seems bad at first (like falling down a rabbit hole) but leads to something wonderful in the end (a whole new world to explore!).

The Fairy Tale Intrusions tables are ways to quickly generate intrusions appropriate to a fairy tale aesthetic. Roll on the appropriate table to determine the intrusion that occurs, or choose one that feels right for the situation.

Interaction Intrusions

| d10 | GM Intrusion |
|----|----|
| 1 | A mischievous brownie attempts to steal an object from the characters in the middle of an important conversation or fight. |
| 2 | The NPC that the characters are talking to suddenly looks at their watch or the sky, says, “I’m late, I’m late,” and disappears. |
| 3 | A character speaks and all of their words come out backward. |
| 4 | The creature that the PCs are fighting or interacting with splits into two versions of itself. |
| 5 | The character that the PCs have been interacting with loses their glamour, and the PCs discover it’s not the person they thought it was. |
| 6 | Death arrives, convinced that one of the characters is someone else. |
| 7 | An opponent uses magic to gain hidden knowledge about a PC and uses it to their advantage in a fight or debate. |
| 8 | The North Wind has taken a liking to one of the characters and does something to help them succeed in their actions. |
| 9 | One of the PCs inadvertently (or purposefully) offends someone, and they are instantly turned into a frog. |
| 10 | An opponent holds up a mirror or other reflective surface at just the right moment, reflecting a spell or ability back on the character. |

World Intrusions

| d10 | GM Intrusion |
|----|----|
| 1 | One or more characters accidentally damage or offend a plant of some type, causing it to retaliate. |
| 2 | A wren starts singing at a nearby crossroads, warning that something’s coming. |
| 3 | One of the characters trips and falls into a rabbit hole. |
| 4 | Someone steals the moon just as the PCs are about to do an important task that requires moonlight. |
| 5 | The tree that the characters are sitting under wakes up. Perhaps it is hungry, or maybe it just wants company. |
| 6 | The path that the characters have been following turns into a rushing river beneath their feet. |
| 7 | Someone casting a curse nearby accidentally catches one of the characters in the magic, causing them to be affected (roll on the Curse table to determine the effect). |
| 8 | A mountain rises up suddenly between the place where the characters stand and the place they need to get to. |
| 9 | Somewhere far off, a magical effect backfires, causing a stampede of wild animals to run right toward the characters. |
| 10 | One of the characters smells gingerbread. The scent is so tempting, they have a hard time turning away from it. |

## PLAYER INTRUSIONS

A player intrusion occurs when a player chooses to alter something in the story, making things easier for a player character. It’s kind of a reverse GM intrusion: instead of the GM giving the player XP and introducing an unexpected complication for a character, the player spends 1 XP

and presents a solution to a problem or complication.

Once Upon a Time: Someone you played with as a child reappears and helps you in whatever you are doing. They may be alive or dead, but your heart is warmed upon seeing them, for it’s been a long time.

As You Wish: You do something that reminds another person or creature in the area of someone they once cared for deeply. They are eager to assist you in whatever you’ve got going on, at least for a few minutes.

Once Upon a Dream: Not long ago, you dreamt of a scenario similar to the one that you find yourself in now. You can’t remember all of the details, but you remember enough to know some of what’s about to take place, and it gives you an additional action to prepare something useful.

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo: A little sprinkle of magic from your fairy godmother is all you need to achieve a goal, retry a task, or be better at something you’re attempting to do.

Wish Upon a Star: Long ago, you helped part of a dying star return to its rightful place in the sky. It keeps an eye on you and, in a moment when it feels like all hope is lost, it sends a little magic or light to aid you.

Dreams Do Come True: Something you wished for long ago comes true just at this moment. It might be for a broken weapon to be fixed, an ally to appear, or a bit of knowledge or understanding to arrive in your mind.

What’s Come to Pass: Not long ago, someone forewarned you of the exact scenario that you find yourself in now. You know just what to do to put yourself at an advantage in the situation.

Think Happy Thoughts: You think of something or someone that brings you great joy, and it imbues your next few actions with magic, allowing you to fly or do some other thing that you are normally unable to do.

I Can Show You the World: Something or someone in the area shows itself to you, highlighting a route you were looking for, an object you had lost, or an answer to a problem.

Happily Ever After: Through the power of your love for another, you use magic to protect someone you care for. They are able to sidestep an attack that would normally do them grave damage.

If a player has no XP to spend, they can’t use a player intrusion.

MINOR AND MAJOR SPECIAL EFFECT OPTIONS 

Any time a PC attempts an action and rolls a natural 19 or 20, they have the option

of triggering a minor special effect or major special effect, respectively. In fairy tales, almost anything goes, which can be overwhelming to a player trying to decide what their character’s special effect might be. Here are a few special effect options for players to use or be inspired by.

Minor Effect Suggestions 

• A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a bit more damage to a foe.

• A fluctuation in magic hinders all of the foe’s tasks for one minute.

• A curse, spell, or ability has additional force behind it, and lasts a round longer than expected.

• The foe’s magical armor begins to dissipate, decreasing the amount of protection it offers on the next attack.

• A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability dazzles the target, easing all tasks related to it.

• A magical attack hits the target and something they were holding, causing damage to both.

Major Effect Suggestions 

• A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a lot more damage to a foe.

• A fluctuation in magic prevents a foe from taking their next action.

• A curse that was cast upon you by the foe you’re attacking is removed.

• A foe surrenders, agreeing to lay down their weapons.

• A foe accidentally steps on a living plant or dangerous creature while trying to dodge your blow, and it attacks them or holds them fast.

• A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability works so well that the foe’s familiar or companion runs off, afraid to continue the fight.

EQUIPMENT 

Most weapons that are powered by magic, such as wands, operate exactly like a regular weapon; they just do their damage using magic.

Equipment and weapons with unique magic abilities are typically considered to be cyphers or artifacts.

## CURRENCY

In most fairy tales, money isn’t precise. Someone might be poor or rich. They might find a bag of gold or a chest full of jewels. They might be the richest man in the town or have nothing but a tired old cow to their name. But typically what they don’t have is “one gold piece” or “thirty farthings” to their name. This means that whatever your fairy tale setting, you can think in general terms of money instead of keeping meticulous track of every penny, farthing, gold coin, or dollar.

To keep things easy, no matter what currency your characters use, think of money as being in simple amounts that scale up, such as a copper coin, a silver coin, and a gold coin. These could easily equate to the inexpensive, moderate, and expensive items on the equipment list. Items that are very expensive might be worth a bag of silver, while exorbitant items might be worth a bag of gold.

Additionally, if the PCs are completing a character arc, accomplishing a task, or doing some other type of action to receive a piece of equipment, you can use the price category to decide how complicated or difficult that task is. A moderately priced item likely requires completing a moderately difficult task, while an exorbitant item may require something that taxes the PCs and really puts their skills and dedication to the test.

## SIGNATURE ITEMS

In fairy tales, clothing, weapons, and other items that a character carries for a long time tend to be very personal and very important. They’re often unique and handcrafted,

they may have names or stories that go with them, and because characters tend to keep them for a long time, they may have undergone repairs or have markings that tell something about the character’s background.

## APPAREL AND ARMOR

In most cases, characters start out by wearing any type of clothing they choose. Typically (unless the GM decides otherwise or unless it is designated as armor),

this clothing is purely for decorative and roleplaying purposes and offers no additional benefits.

However, clothing with additional benefits can be purchased, stolen, found, or earned by completing favors and accomplishing tasks.

## OPTIONAL RULES FOR SCIENCE FICTION

Establishing a Technology Rating

Every science fiction setting has an implicit level of advancement, which is the average degree of technological sophistication available to most characters. This sophistication lies along a spectrum, from contemporary, to advanced, all the way to fantastic. Each of these terms specifies a particular “technology rating” (or “tech rating” for short). 

A tech rating is a handy way of helping you select what equipment your characters can use in chapter 7 and chapter 8, which optional rules you’d like to include from chapter 6, and maybe even help guide your creature choice from chapter 9. 

On the other hand, you could choose to make all options available, regardless of tech rating. No technology police will cite you if you don’t stick inside a previously declared lane. The setting is your background for telling a compelling story. Does your setting have faster-than-light travel? Great. Unless it’s integral to the story (or fun for you), don’t worry about justifying it if you’ve generally settled on an advanced rating for your hard science fiction game (which doesn’t normally include FTL capability). In fact, the surprising and unexpected are where excitement is usually found in a setting; breaking the established rules (for a good reason) often leads to interesting results.

## COSMIC SET PIECES AND OPTIONAL RULES

This chapter contains a variety of subsystems and set pieces that you can choose to incorporate in your game, depending on the kind of setting you’d like to run. Options here run the gamut from making your science fiction setting more realistic to making your fantastic games even wilder by introducing rules for posthuman advancement and psionics.

## QUICK DESCRIPTIONS FOR COMMON SCI-FI SITUATIONS

Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, first time:The sensation of falling jerks through the body; instincts scream to reach out and catch yourself. 

Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, once acclimated: A feeling of lightness, evanescence, like floating in a pool of water, if the water were clear air. A little push sends you gliding. 

High acceleration feels like (if strapped in): A massive kick in the back, followed by the sensation of tremendous weights sitting on your chest. Any movement is a struggle against an overwhelming weight holding you down. 

Blacking out from high acceleration feels like: Lightheaded and hard to think, a sensation of a slowing pulse. Noises soften as if heard through a drainpipe. Color fades from vision, then everything goes either to black, or possibly to white, as consciousness lapses. 

Exposure to hard radiation feels like: Heat. (The more dangerous the radiation, the hotter it feels, and may be accompanied by blue light; radiation excites electrons in the air that then slip back into an unexcited state, emitting high-energy photons that glow blue.) 

Exposure to vacuum feels like: Breath explodes out of lungs, cold slashes the body like a knife carved from a glacier. Tears freeze in the corners of eyes, ice forms on teeth and tongue. Moisture boils out of ears, scalp, freezing on exposed skin, lips, and eyelids. (As this happens, the Effects of Vacuum also take their mechanical toll on the character.)

## OPTIONAL RULES: HARDER SCIENCE FICTION

Hard science fiction is distinguished from other science fiction subgenres by the perception of scientific accuracy. This means hard science fiction often precludes technology deemed impossible by mainstream scientific theory, including mainstays like faster-than-light travel and time travel. Choosing a hard science fiction setting also means the GM is interested in sprinkling realistic hazards into their game, at least up to a point. After all, the difficulties of real-life space travel offer tremendous breadth when it comes to providing excitement (i.e., life-threatening dangers) that can raise the stakes in an authentic fashion. Not to say that gun battles with space aliens aren’t exciting, but in a hard science fiction setting without aliens, there are all kinds of opportunities for pulse-pounding GM intrusions. 

In fact, that bears repeating: Use GM intrusions to incorporate these harder science fiction repercussions when the situation is relevant. Rather than hitting your PCs over the head with an information-exposition hammer on the dangers of space repeatedly, simply demonstrate it with a relevant GM intrusion. 

The Cypher System Rulebook describes some hard science fiction considerations regarding the effects of gravity, which are summarized here for ease of reference.

Long-Term Microgravity Exposure: Long-term penalties (such as inabilities in physical tasks), unless ameliorated with advanced drugs such as space-fit serum or space-fit nano-tabs. 

Low Gravity: Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons, inflict 2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point) unless user is trained in low-gravity maneuvering. Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very long range. 

High Gravity: All physical tasks are hindered. Ranges in high gravity are reduced by one category (very long-range weapons reach only to long range, long-range weapons reach only to short range, and short-range weapons reach only to immediate range). Those trained in highgravity maneuvering ignore the change in difficulty but not the range decreases. 

Zero Gravity: All physical tasks are hindered. Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very-long range.

## VOID RULES

The extreme environment in space— hard radiation, lack of air and pressure, wild temperature variations, and lack of gravity—tends to magnify small issues into much more significant ones. While Murphy’s Law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong) is a useful reminder to keep an eye out for trouble even under regular circumstances, Finagle’s Law reigns in space, which is that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong—at the worst possible moment. To evoke this law, GMs can implement Void Rules. 

The idea is to create a feeling of increased repercussions by changing one die roll mechanic. In the game, activities on a planet’s surface—and within a functioning air-filled spacecraft, habitat, or space suit when everything is going well—remain normal. The PCs interact with each other and the NPCs, investigate, research, repair an external sensor module, travel, and so on. 

But that could change the moment something goes wrong—maybe a fault is recognized in the spacecraft’s computer or shipmind. A minor leak is detected in the cargo bay. An enemy spacecraft has fired on and damaged the PC’s spacecraft. The spacecraft’s orbit is deteriorating. Whatever. The point is, the situation has suddenly become complicated. In space, when a situation becomes complicated, it also becomes potentially deadly. That’s when you have the option to announce you’ve instituted Void Rules. 

While using Void Rules, GM intrusions governed by die rolls change. Normally this happens only on a roll of 1, but when Void Rules apply, it becomes a roll of 1 or a 2. Void Rules are similar in many ways to Horror Mode, though the threat range doesn’t normally continue to escalate. 

While Void Rules are in effect, the GM intrusions automatically triggered should play off the situation, influenced as much as possible by the realistic dangers space travel has on the human body and the situation at hand

Choosing Instead of Rolling: Each GM intrusion is keyed to a die result, usually a d6. The die range is not meant to imply you should always randomly generate a GM intrusion. Instead of rolling, choose the conflict that you think will make the story better and more exciting. The option to roll is really only here if you can’t decide (and are facing decision fatigue). Mainly, these GM intrusion tables are provided as a quick way to inspire complications for a given situation. 

## EFFECTS OF VACUUM

In terms of game mechanics, an unprotected character in vacuum moves one step down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If not, they die

## VACUUM GM INTRUSIONS

| d6 | GM Intrusions (Choose Best Option) |
|----|----|
| 01 | The character notices a crack in their space suit or ship. It’s not breached now, but may soon become a serious problem. |
| 02 | A breach in another part of the ship or space station causes automatic safety pressure baffles to close that section off. A character might be caught in that area of the ship, or in an area of a descending baffle, which inflicts serious damage on the character (these things are made to resist obstructions and form a seal). |
| 03 | A previously unknown crack in a space suit or ship begins to leak. It doesn’t cause a blow-out, but unless the crack can be repaired or sealed, those affected will eventually be exposed to vacuum. |
| 04 | A catastrophic blow-out exposes the character or characters to vacuum. It may also send them spiraling out into the void, depending on the situation. |
| 05 | Vacuum exposure causes the character to projectile vomit, effectively rendering them unable to take an action on their next turn. |
| 06 | Vacuum exposure causes the character to go temporarily blind, which is only relieved a few minutes after normal atmosphere is restored. |

## SPACE SUITS ARE FALLIBLE

Even if advanced tech or fantastic tech is available, space suits are susceptible to all kinds of mishaps. Of course, that’s especially true for contemporary tech space suits, which work hard at keeping a constant internal air volume so that a wearer doesn’t have to continually exert themselves to hold the suit in a given position or pre-breathe oxygen at a higher concentration. “Hard-shell” suits manage this with multiple joints and segments that shift on ball bearings, and by being able to maintain a higher internal pressure than soft suits.

## SPACE SUITS GM INTRUSIONS

| d6 | GM Intrusions (Choose Best Option) |
|----|----|
| 01 | An ill-fitted suit (or one whose auto-fit function is malfunctioning) unexpectedly hinders the character’s action |
| 02 | Mechanical joints in the suit freeze unexpectedly, hindering all the character’s actions (or completely paralyzing the character) until repairs can be made. |
| 03 | A stuck valve causes the drinking water bulb to get stuck “on” and water begins filling the helmet. This could blind and/or drown the character if not dealt with |
| 04 | Space sickness/a tumble/a spin nauseates the character. If they vomit in their helmet, they are blinded until such time as the helmet can be removed and cleaned. |
| 05 | An electrical short from an external tool or piece of hardware fries the space suit’s electronics, limiting communication to helmet-tohelmet touch (if in a vacuum where sound doesn’t propagate), use of micro thrusters, and limits air supply to just a quarter of what was previously available. |
| 06 | A bloated suit from an overpressure incident hinders all tasks, but is not lethal . . . until the suit won’t quite fit back into the airlock. |

## EFFECTS OF ACCELERATION AND HIGH-G MANEUVERS

In a fantastic tech setting where gravitic control usually cancels inertia, spacecraft acceleration (or deceleration) is only an issue when the gravitic systems malfunction. But acceleration is always something everyone has to deal with in contemporary or advanced tech settings.

Of course, massive acceleration (or deceleration) is just plain lethal. Someone who jumps off a ten-story building is subject to several hundred Gs when they suddenly stop. Less extreme is still dangerous, because it pulls blood out of pilots’ and passengers’ heads, rendering them unconscious. This can happen at just 4 or 5 Gs without any amelioration, though contemporary tech allows fighter craft pilots to withstand up to 9 Gs for limited periods. Advanced tech methods, which include acceleration serum, allow characters to survive the kind of Gs a spacecraft might pull for extended trips or during battle, up to a maximum of 15 Gs. Ships have limiters that normally prevent them from thrusting at higher speeds. Normally.

## ACCELERATION AND HIGH-G MANEUVER GM INTRUSIONS

| d6 | GM Intrusions (Choose Best Option) |
|----|----|
| 01 | After high-G maneuvers, even with amelioration, tissue bruising results, giving the character black eyes, which take a few days to clear. |
| 02 | While under high Gs, a tool or piece of equipment comes loose, accelerates through the craft, and strikes the character, inflicting damage. The bigger the tool and the farther it falls before striking the character, the more damage is inflicted, possibly including being knocked a step down the damage track. |
| 03 | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character suffers minor cardiac problems, likely to grow worse over time (or until medical treatment is sought). |
| 04 | While under high Gs (or afterward), a mild brain aneurysm causes the character to have a sudden headache and blurred vision, which hinders all vision-related tasks until medical treatment is received. |
| 05 | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character begins to have a hard time breathing. The reason is that a lung or lungs have partially collapsed. All tasks are hindered by two steps until the character dies after several hours or until medical treatment is received.  |
| 06 | The character has a stroke, and descends two steps on the damage track. They remain debilitated until medical treatment is received |

## LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO ZERO G AND RADIATION

In a setting with contemporary tech, a variety of issues related to long-term exposure to micro-gravity and high radiation beset astronauts, including bone and muscle loss, less circulating blood and red cell mass, less ability to constrict and dilate in vessels, irregular hormones, diminished immune system, inability of mitochondria to initiate wound healing, and even shortened telomeres. The inability to heal even minor wounds and nicks until a space-farer returns to stronger gravity will eventually prove lethal, though a snapped bone or normally inconsequential virus or parasite could also do them in.

## SPACE HEALTH HAZARD GM INTRUSIONS

| d6 | GM Intrusions (Choose Best Option) |
|----|----|
| 01 | Space sickness happens to everyone eventually. Nauseated characters are hindered in all tasks and may vomit unexpectedly. |
| 02 | A wrist bone, thinner than it should be due to long-term exposure to microgravity, breaks. |
| 03 | Upon return to full gravity after a long period in zero G or low G, the character stands up and then passes out. (This “orthostatic intolerance” fades in a few hours.) |
| 04 | Vision becomes distorted because the character’s eyes literally take on a new shape in zero G, all vision-related tasks are hindered |
| 05 | Despite precautions, sometimes viruses infect a character. The common cold virus is, ridiculously enough, still not preventable in advanced settings, and if anything, has even more severe symptoms for those in microgravity. The character descends one step on the damage track until they get better. |
| 06 | The character is diagnosed with cancer. Depending on the tech setting, it is amenable to medical intervention (or at least long-term treatment to keep symptoms controlled), if that intervention comes soon enough. |

MOVING IN MICROGRAVITY 

Long-term zero G is dangerous, but there are issues associated with moving around in microgravity. Those who have spent at least a little time in microgravity can move as part of a routine action. It’s only when something else distracting or dangerous is happening simultaneously that routine movements through a ship or station become potentially problematic.

## MOVING IN MICROGRAVITY GM INTRUSIONS

| d6 | GM Intrusions (Choose Best Option) |
|----|----|
| 01 | A misjudged jump uses too much force and the character takes damage when they hit an unexpected bulkhead or other obstruction, or too little force, leaving them stranded in the middle of an open area |
| 02 | A misjudged jump in microgravity causes the character to strike an important control surface that sets off a secondary issue, causes the character to jump to a dangerous location, or causes their tether (apparently previously abraded) to snap and send them spiraling out into space. |
| 03 | A tool, weapon, or other piece of equipment—even one that should have a tether or magnetic clamp— dislodges and floats away. |
| 04 | A mishap causes the character to spin wildly, hindering all tasks by two steps from disorientation and nausea. Without outside aid, micro thrusters, or some other useful strategy, stopping a spin is difficult. |
| 05 | An ally accidentally jostles the character, and they are sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump. |
| 06 | When attempting to grab a resisting target or panicking ally, or after some kind unexpected shake or violent ship maneuver, the character is sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump. |

## OPTIONAL RULES: EXTENDED VEHICULAR COMBAT (SPACECRAFT COMBAT)

When vehicular combat occurs—which happens whenever the PCs are completely enclosed in a vehicle so that it’s not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles— start with the vehicular combat rules described in the Cypher System Rulebook. 

However, if you’d like to provide the PCs with more options designed especially for spacecraft combat, use these optional rules instead, which include a “redline maneuver” system for trying extremely risky spacecraft maneuvers, bridge combat options, and more. The base vehicular combat rules have been integrated into these extended rules, so you don’t need to continually cross-reference them to understand how it all works.

In extended vehicular combat, PCs on a spacecraft take actions on their turn, just like in a standard Cypher System combat encounter. Use standard initiative rules to determine when PCs take their actions, and when enemy spacecraft take theirs. Characters will be crewing specific spacecraft system stations described under Bridge Combat, and thus could attempt a piloting maneuver, to fire the ship weapons, to scan the enemy craft for weaknesses, or to attempt some similar spacecraft operation task on their turn. Alternatively, they might be somewhere else on the ship attempting repairs, fighting off boarders, attempting to open communications in order to negotiate, or taking some other action. 

For their part, enemy spacecraft are likely to fire on the same systems aboard a PCs’ spacecraft as the ones the PCs are firing on (weapons, defenses, engines, or even a kill shot). The PC pilot rolls one or more defense rolls. The enemy spacecraft faces the same modifications the PCs face when targeting a particular system (as described hereafter), except those modifications ease or hinder the PC making the defense roll, since NPC craft never roll themselves. And, if an enemy ship manages to disable a system on the PCs’ ship on an attack, PCs can attempt repair tasks to get those systems back online on their turns. 

The main difference between spacecraft combat and regular combat is that the difficulty of tasks that the PCs attempt in relation to the enemy craft varies a lot more than in regular combat. In normal combat, a task difficulty is usually equal to the foe’s level. But in spacecraft combat, a task difficulty is equal to a modified task difficulty (beginning with the spacecraft’s level, but moving on from there, as noted hereafter). The modified difficulty always applies to anything characters attempt in regard to the enemy spacecraft, whether a PC fires at an enemy ship, dodges return fire, attempts to scan the enemy spacecraft, attempts to repair damage caused by the enemy spacecraft, and so on.

It’s actually similar to a normal task. For example, when a PC scans a robot, the task difficulty is usually the robot’s level, but not always. Sometimes the robot’s effective level is modified because of intrinsic skills or systems the robot possesses, or because of something it does making it harder (or easier) for it to be scanned. In the case of spacecraft combat, modification is pretty much a given, and is even more variable. So variable, in fact, that a space combat status tracker has been provided. to turn potentially confusing conflicts into something as easy as looking at a marker to know what the difficulty for a particular task is.

The modifiers that apply, even before PCs attempt a specific combat task noted under Bridge Combat, are as follows.

## BASE COMBAT TASK MODIFIERS

The following modifiers change the effective level of the enemy of the spacecraft for a given task by hindering or easing a PC’s roll. Track each change in effective level on the space combat status tracker

## SPACECRAFT LEVEL DIFFERENCE

Compare the levels of the spacecraft involved in the conflict. If the PCs’ vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels becomes a reduction in the difficulty of attack and defense rolls PCs might make. If the PCs’ vehicle has the lower level, the difference is an increase in difficulty by the same amount. If the levels are the same, there is no modification. 

## MISMATCHED TECH RATING

It’s possible that vehicles from different tech ratings will fight each other at some point, or become caught up in a larger multi-vehicle fight. When they do, each step difference in tech rating between two opposed vehicles increases the effective level of the higher-rated vehicle by two steps.

## VEHICLE COORDINATION  
If two vehicles coordinate their attack against an enemy vehicle, the attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is eased by two steps. 

## SUPERIOR SHIP SYSTEMS

Some vehicles have superior weapons or defenses, as noted in the specific vehicle listing in chapter 8. If a vehicle has a superior system, treat that vehicle as if one level higher than its actual level when figuring attacks or evasion tasks if that specific system is involved.

## REDLINE MANEUVER

When someone with access to spacecraft controls attempts a particularly audacious and risky maneuver, it’s a “redline” maneuver. Essentially, declaring a redline maneuver eases one task a PC attempts in a spacecraft under duress, but comes with a concomitant risk. 

To make a redline maneuver, a character spends 1 XP as a free action. In doing so, they unlock the option for all the PCs to attempt to redline for rest of the combat. To redline, a PC describes the dangerous thing they want to attempt, then takes that action. Mechanically, the PC eases the particular task they are attempting (which might just be to fire at the enemy craft’s weapons), but increases the GM intrusion range by two points. 

A character who redlines could opt to increase their gamble by easing a task by two steps or even more; however, each step increases the GM intrusion range by another two points that round. 

Redline maneuvers are also available in desperate non-combat situations aboard a spacecraft. For example, Tammie’s ship is caught in a decaying orbit over Venus, and the ship doesn’t have enough power left to break out. She tells the GM that she’s going to try an extremely risky maneuver that involves igniting ALL the remaining power at once, hoping that the explosive thrust will succeed in blowing the craft into a higher orbit. Because things are desperate, she commits to easing the task by two steps after paying 1 XP. This easing (plus any skill, application of Effort, and so on) gives her a pretty decent chance of succeeding, except the GM intrusion range is now 1–5. 

If a GM intrusion is triggered, something goes wrong. Remember that success might still be possible if the roll was high enough, but still falls within the increased GM intrusion range.

If you’re looking for inspiration for appropriate GM intrusions when a redlining PC triggers one, refer to suggested GM intrusions presented under Bridge Combat hereafter, each associated with a particular ship system that a character is probably crewing. 

After any round where a redline maneuver was attempted, the GM intrusion range returns to normal (1 on a 1d20) as the next round beings. 

Multiple Redline Maneuvers: Only one PC needs to spend 1 XP to unlock redline maneuvers for themselves and for any other PCs aboard the same spacecraft for the duration of a single encounter. Multiple redline attempts during the same round by two or more PCs additively increase the GM intrusion range for that round. So, a PC attempting to redline who takes their turn after previous redline attempts that round faces a GM intrusion range that’s already inflated, and which will inflate more when they redline. (PCs who do not redline during a particular round don’t have to worry about the increasing GM intrusion range for their action.)

Thus, while PCs do not need to pre-announce their intention to redline at the beginning of each round, coordinating wouldn’t be a bad idea. Whichever PC redlines last in a round where redline maneuvers were already attempted could face a fairly significant GM intrusion range. 

If Void Rules are also being used and have triggered, redline maneuvers are even more dangerous.

## THE SUPERIORITY OF A WELL-CREWED SPACECRAFT

A spacecraft with some or all of the PCs crewing different systems stations will be more capable than a regular spacecraft in combat. Which means that an enemy spacecraft that might prove challenging based on its level might actually be fairly easily handled by PCs who fully understand their options. 

But be careful, because even competent PCs should fear squadrons of enemy ships, and military craft with several weapon systems. Even a single level difference is magnified, so make sure not to capriciously throw spacecraft at the PCs that are 2 levels higher than their own

## BRIDGE COMBAT

If several PCs are aboard the same spacecraft, give them the following option: ask each PC to crew one of the ship system stations, including weapons (of which there could be more than one system, requiring more than one PC to crew them all), piloting, and science and engineering (which could be divided into two stations with similar functionality). A spacecraft generally has a number of system stations equal to its level. PCs on spacecraft that are lower level must flip between system controls as part of another action, using two stations or even just one station for the whole ship. Even if a PC flips a station (reconfigures, as engineers like to say), only a single PC can crew a station (and take an action using it) each round.

When crewing their stations, PCs have several station-specific options available to them. What they do can bears on how the encounter plays out on a round-to-round basis, similar to regular combat. Specific options are provided for each station, but characters are free to attempt other actions they can think of.

The following ship systems might be found on larger spacecraft with room for more than a single pilot.

Shipmind System Control: 

Some ships with integrated AIs (shipminds) can control a particular system autonomously, without a PC. When it acts in this fashion, it can only take a single action each round, which means it could attack and move, but not also attempt a complicated engineering or defensive maneuver. A shipmind acts at a level equal to the overall spacecraft. In addition, shipmind actions against an enemy spacecraft are assessed with the same modifiers for targeting as a PC crewing the station.

## WEAPONS

A spacecraft may have more than one weapon system. Each individual weapon system has its own station, which can be crewed by a separate PC. Spacecraft systems are considered heavy weapons (which means some characters may be practiced in their use, though others may have an inability). A spacecraft can potentially make as many attacks each round as weapon systems it possesses, if each station is crewed. 

Refer to PC Weapon System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

WEAPON SYSTEM GM INTRUSIONS 

| d6 | GM Intrusions (Choose Best Option) |
|----|----|
| 01 | Weapon overheats, off-line next turn, unless quickly repaired. |
| 02 | Mistargeting, allied craft damaged, hindering its actions next turn. |
| 03 | Weapon malfunctions, requires repair before weapon can fire again. |
| 04 | Weapon station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair. |
| 05 | Weapon malfunctions, station pulses with electrical feedback damaging everyone on bridge. Requires repair. |
| 06 | Weapon melts to slag, must be replaced at a shipyard. |

## PILOTING

Many spacecraft have only a single system and dedicated station for piloting and navigation, suitable for a single PC to crew, though a larger craft could split those duties. A PC piloting a ship during combat can attempt any number of piloting tasks, as well as any other type of flying that they deem necessary. While not in combat, the PC crewing this station pilots the ship from place to place in space. 

Refer to PC Piloting System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

A successful piloting defense task is not always a miss: A failed enemy attack doesn’t always mean it misses a character’s craft. The PC’s spacecraft might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of the damage was absorbed by the hull or shields, so there’s no significant damage.

PILOTING SYSTEM GM INTRUSIONS 

| d6 | GM Intrusions  |
|----|----|
| 01 | Starcraft drive stutters, off-line next turn, unless quickly repaired. |
| 02 | Miscalculated flight vector occludes or disrupts allied craft, hindering its actions next turn. |
| 03 | Drive malfunction requires repair before drive will function again. |
| 04 | Piloting station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair |
| 05 | Unexpected thrust exposes everyone on ship to a moment of extreme Gs, inflicting damage on everyone. Secondary systems may require repair. |
| 06 | Drive will imminently die, must be replaced at a shipyard (though it can be nursed to life just a little longer with some redline engineering). |

## SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

A spacecraft may have more than one science and engineering system. Each science and engineering system has a station, each of which can be crewed by a separate PC. A spacecraft can potentially attempt as many science and engineering tasks each round as stations systems it possesses, if each one is crewed. 

Refer to PC Science & Engineering System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

PILOTING SYSTEM GM INTRUSIONS 

| d6 | GM Intrusions  |
|----|----|
| 01 | Shields (or basic hull integrity) compromised, all ship defense tasks hindered this round. |
| 02 | Sensors compromised, all spacecraft tasks hindered this round. |
| 03 | Shields (or basic hull integrity) seriously compromised, all ship defense tasks hindered until repair is completed. |
| 04 | Station malfunctions, sparking with electrical feedback, damaging PC. Requires repair until station will function again. |
| 05 | Sensors seriously compromised, hindering all piloting and weapons task by two steps until repaired. |
| 06 | Hull integrity breached, atmosphere begins to vent, and possibly one or two crew too near the hole are at risk of being sucked out. Unless repaired, ship atmosphere is lost to space within a few minutes.  |

## OPTIONAL: COMMAND

Ships with a captain may have a Command station, possibly a captain’s chair, though the captain might just crew one of the other stations. Sometimes those with captain’s privileges also have the Captain’s Calm special ability. Normally, a captain commanding someone else to do something can’t redline; it would be up to the person who received the command whether to try to redline or not, and to face any GM intrusion consequences.

## BRIDGE COMBAT AT THE TABLE

Running a combat using these extended rules is straightforward. 

Know your stuff: First, familiarize yourself with the material. 

Assign characters a station: Next, if you have some time to prepare, copy the two-page spread containing the various PC system options, and give one to each player. Tell them to figure out what stations they are crewing, based on the number of systems their ship has (usually no more systems than the level of the ship). You will probably also have to explain the basics.

Deploy space combat status tracker: Also make a copy of the one-page space combat status tracker and set it on the table so everyone can see. It’ll make a huge difference in how your space combat plays out. The status tracker allows you (and the players) to easily mark the difficulty of current space combat task a PC is attempting, without having to hold all the easing and hindering in your heads, or having to write them out each time. 

Space Combat Status Tracker Instructions: Using dice (or similar objects) as markers, track the difficulty of the current task that a PC is attempting, as well as the GM intrusion range for that round if any character is attempting to redline. Place the marker in the column appropriate to the kind of task being attempted (attack, defense, or other) at the starting difficulty level. If the PCs face more than one enemy spacecraft, use different colored dice to represent different ships, or separate copies of this status tracker for each additional enemy spacecraft. 

At the end of each full round, reset all the markers on the tracker to their base state, unless some effect causes a modification that lasts longer than a round. Be sure to reset the GM intrusion marker, too.

Roll initiative: Begin the combat, with the enemy spacecraft of your choice taking on the PCs’ ship. Decide whether the enemy spacecraft are already in weapon range (it’s your call, we’re not tracking that here), and if not, how soon they will be close enough to begin attacking, and let the combat flow

## VEHICLES FIGHTING CREATURES

Spacecraft vs. Colossal Creatures: If a creature is as capable as a spacecraft, treat it that way when it comes to vehicular combat. Instead of adjusting for mismatched tech rating, treat the creature’s effective level as if three levels less than its actual level. Extrapolate “weapon systems” to the creature’s attack methods, defenses to its weird organic plating, and so on. Killing such a creature means taking out its “power core or other vital spot.”

Spacecraft vs. Regular Creatures: If a vehicle weapon system fires on an unprotected PC (or a PC in a spacecraft fires ship weapons on a creature outside the craft that isn’t colossal), it’s an entirely different situation. Attacks against a vehicle’s systems face all the previously mentioned modifiers. On top of that, add an additional five steps of hindrance to attacks by a regular creature against a starcraft.

A PC defending from a spacecraft’s attack is hindered by five steps. Except in this case, the spacecraft inflicts damage. Given that ship weapons compared to handheld weapons are an order of magnitude apart when it comes to power, a good rule of thumb is that a spacecraft’s weapon inflicts 25 points of damage on a successful hit and knocks the character one step down the damage track. Even if the character succeeds on their defense roll, they still take 5 points of damage.

## PC WEAPON SYSTEM OPTIONS

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities) and Effort, as usual. 

| Targeting Task | Hindrance | Effect on Target Craft |
|----|----|----|
| Disable weapons | Two steps | One or more of the target’s weapons disabled |
| Disable defenses (if applicable) | Two steps | Attacks against the target are eased  |
| Disable engine/drive | Three steps | Target cannot move, or movement is hampered  |
| Disable maneuverability | Two steps | Target cannot alter its present course |
| Strike power core or vital spot | Five steps | Target is completely destroyed |
| Attempt target lock | – | Spend one round aiming, the next attack is eased  |
| Coordinate fire | – | If PC’s ship has second weapon system, coordinate fire with it, providing that system an asset this round. (This weapon doesn’t make a separate attack) |
| Redline attack | – | Overcharge weapons, ricochet shot, or some other risky gamble |

PC PILOTING SYSTEM OPTIONS  

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities) and Effort, as usual. 

| Piloting Task | Hindrance | Effect on Target Craft |
|----|----|----|
| Evasive maneuvers | One step | Defenses eased three steps, but attacks this round hindered by the same amount |
| Increase separation | One step | Defenses eased one step, attacks hindered by one step, but creates chance to lose enemy aircraft (see below) |
| Decrease separation | – | Negates chance of losing enemy craft this round |
| Stealth approach | Three steps | So long as no attack is made, pilot’s craft can ‘snug’ up to much larger enemy craft and hide from its sensors |
| Lose enemy craft | Four steps | If separation is first increased as a separate task (or maneuverability is disabled), target craft loses track of pilot’s craft behind a moon, in a debris belt, etc |
| Study enemy flying | – | Spend one round watching enemy tactics, the next piloting task is eased |
| Fly in formation | – | If another allied ship is part of the combat, coordinate with it, providing that ship an asset in its next piloting task |
| Redline maneuver | – | Spinning, flying through a dangerous region, or some other gamble |

PC SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING SYSTEM OPTIONS  

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities) and Effort, as usual. 

| Science and Engineering Task | Hindrance | Effect on Target Craft (or on PC’s craft) |
|----|----|----|
| Scan | – | Gain basic information, such as whether other ships are in the area, if such ships are in yet within combat range, if reinforcements might be in the offing, and so on |
| Tactical scane | One step | Learn the level of identified enemy spacecraft |
| Deep scan | Two steps | Enemy spacecraft weakness discovered, next task chosen by this character for another PC is eased (usually a piloting or weapons task) |
| Jam/Hack | Two steps | Requires three success before two failures (thus a minimum of three rounds); if successful, enemy ship takes no actions for a couple of rounds until they regain control by severing the communications link; during this time, all tasks against enemy craft are eased by two steps |
| Open comunications | Two steps | Attempt to parlay; at the very least, success causes the enemy spacecraft to delay at least one round, which could be the end of it, or open further dialouge  |
| Reconfigure station | – | Changes the system that the station controls. Useful when another station is damaged or the PC crewing another station is disabled; reconfiguration locks out options from whatever system is previously controlled unless reconfigured again; can be done as part of another action  |
| Effect repair | – | Sometimes a character can repair a subsystem from their station, but repair may require moving to another part of the ship, such as the drive chamber, the compartment where weapons are sleeved, or even onto the outer hull. The difficulty is equal to the modified difficulty of the enemy craft that caused the damage.  |
| Redline science/engineering | – | Reverse polarity on the sensors, dig up some bizarre lore from a database that could change the situation somehow, make the hull reflective, or some other risky gambit  |

## OPTIONAL RULE: PSIONICS

Through sheer force of will, a psionic character can unleash inborn mental abilities such as telepathy, precognition, and telekinesis. As a GM, your first decision must be whether you want to incorporate psionics into your setting.

If you do not want to allow psionics into your game, then restrict foci like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind Over Matter, and Separates Mind From Body. And of course, restrict the suggested types of Psion and Psychic Knight described in the Cypher System Rulebook.

## LATENT PSIONICS

Under the latent psionics rule, any character, no matter their role or type, can unlock a psionic ability (either purposefully, or accidentally), as a long-term benefit (see “first psi ability” hereafter). After they unlock one psionic ability, they may unlock more later if they wish (or if their ability seeks to reveal itself), or just try to stick with the one.

FIRST PSI ABILITY 

Any character can unlock a psionic ability by spending 3 XP and working with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character unlocked it. 

Next, choose one low-tier ability from Chapter 9: Abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their psionic ability, with a few caveats. The ability can’t be used like a normal ability gained through a PC’s type or focus. Instead, a character must either expend a recovery roll or spend many minutes or longer evoking the psionic ability before it takes effect, in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).

Expending a Recovery Roll to Manifest a Psionic Ability: If the character expends a one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll as part of the same action to manifest a psionic ability (including paying any Pool costs), they can use the ability as an action.

Expending Time to Manifest a Psionic Ability: If the character takes at least ten minutes meditating, concentrating deeply, or otherwise using all their actions, they can manifest a low-tier psionic ability (if they also pay any Pool costs). An hour is required to manifest mid-tier abilities. Ten hours are required to manifest a high-tier ability.

MORE PSI ABILITIES 

Once a character has unlocked at least one psionic ability, they can opt to unlock additional abilities later. Each time, they must spend an additional 3 XP and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character’s mental development has progressed. 

Two additional rules for learning additional psionic abilities apply: First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously unlocked one low-tier psionic ability before they can learn a mid-tier psionic ability. Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously unlocked one mid-tier psionic ability before they can unlock a high-tier ability.

## PSIONS AND THE OPTIONAL LATENT PSIONICS RULE

Characters with explicitly psionic foci like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind over Matter, Separates Mind from Body, and possibly others—as well types like Psion and Psychic Knight—are also considered to be psionic characters, and moreover, specialized ones. Their psionic abilities— provided by their type or focus—are used simply by paying their Pool costs. Extra time or physical effort isn’t required to manifest them. That’s because they’ve trained to use those abilities, rather than having stumbled upon them accidentally like a latent character. 

Specialized characters can use the optional latency rule to further expand their psionic potential, unlocking it just like other characters, with the same limitations.

Optionally, specialized characters who have a psionic type and/or focus gain one additional benefit if they also opt for latent abilities. Given that they are already adept at unlocking abilities and using them as quickly and easily as another character might shoot a laser pistol, they’ve got some flexibility. Such a PC can replace up to three abilities granted by their type and/or focus with three other psionic abilities they’ve unlocked as a latent ability of the same tier. To do so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour in meditation. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery. 

## MORE POWERFUL PSIONICS

As the GM, you could allow a PC to spend 4 XP to unlock a new psionic ability instead of 3 XP. Such an ability is treated more like a regular type or focus ability. Such an ability is still governed by the rules described under More Psi Abilities, but is not subject to the limitations for manifesting the ability (i.e., expending a recovery roll or lots of time); instead, the user simply pays their Pool costs to use them. 

## OPTIONAL RULE: POSTHUMAN UPGRADES

Posthuman upgrades are either available to everyone as the setting begins or opened up later during the campaign as a significant plot development. Note that many focus and type abilities might be considered to have come from the kind up bodily upgrades normally associated with posthuman transformation, especially high-tier abilities. Which is one way to go. On the other hand, you could provide actual upgrades, such as presented here, which actually increase the base power level of characters. 

## INTRODUCING UPGRADES TO YOUR SETTING

You have a few options for adding posthuman upgrades to your setting. Characters might gain an initial upgrade for “free,” mechanically speaking. After that, you might decide that that’s enough and they’re done. 

Or, you could allow further upgrades, each requiring them to expend 4 XP and serving as an Other Option requirement for advancing their character. In this case, consider expanding the number of steps required for advancing a tier from four to five. (Obtaining additional posthuman upgrades reflects characters accessing latent abilities already present inside them, or going back to whatever source granted the upgrades in the first place, if that’s something you want to allow.)

Immediate Posthuman Upgrades: As part of character creation, PCs are given the options presented hereafter because the setting demands it. Narrative options include (but are not limited to):

 • PCs are part of a program designed to adapt them to being able to survive and thrive in conditions other than the 1 G, 1 atmosphere, oxygenated, Goldilocks environment of the Earth.

• PCs begin their career as super-soldiers to fight aliens or to serve as corporate spies.

 • PCs serve as long-lived guardians to watch over a generation ship hurtling at slower-than-light speeds between the stars. 

• PCs are children of a far-future civilization that routinely upgrades its citizens. 

Delayed Posthuman Upgrades: Sometime after the players have a few sessions under their belt, present the options hereafter to the PCs because of a dramatic update to the plot. If one PC gains the option to upgrade, then all the PCs should have that same advantage. Narrative options include (but are not limited to): 

• PCs, exploring a cache of ancient ultra or other fantastic tech, find a device that provides unexpected upgrades in the process of healing them from other injuries. 

• PCs are kidnapped by aliens or conglomerate operatives, and upgraded—with some command-andcontrol circuits also installed—to serve some specific purpose.

 • PCs learn a “new science,” allowing them to tap cosmic energies other creatures are unaware of.

## POSTHUMAN PACKAGES

Posthuman “packages” that PCs might enjoy include the following. You should decide which are available, and which ones your PCs gain. 

Spaceborn: You are not adversely affected by long-term microgravity or high-radiation conditions common in space. In addition, you can withstand high acceleration (up to 15 G) for about an hour without passing out, having a stroke, a heart attack, and so on (though longer periods of acceleration could still result in such outcomes). Add +1 to your Intellect Edge. Enabler. (PCs without the spaceborn posthuman upgrade probably have to rely on supplementation with adjuvants if they travel in space, such as space-fit serum)

Jupiterborn: You can withstand high-gravity planets and high acceleration (up to 15 G) indefinitely. For periods of up to an hour, you can withstand double that. Add +1 to your Might Edge. Enabler. 

Seaborn: You can breathe underwater in pressures of up to 100 atmospheres indefinitely, up to triple that for about an hour. You have an asset to all tasks performed in water. Add +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler. 

Expanded Consciousness: Only one of your brain hemispheres sleeps at a time, so you are always awake and aware. In addition, you have a magnetoreception sixth sense that allows you to “see” into objects and through doors up to a short distance. Your initiative and perception tasks are eased. You can forge a connection with electronic equipment you touch, allowing you to attempt to communicate, analyze, or even hack the device. Enabler. 

Synthetic Body: You have left biology behind and uploaded yourself into a biomechanical form known as a synth. You enjoy the benefits of the spaceborn package and expanded consciousness package, and one posthuman power shift. Enabler.

## POSTHUMAN POWER SHIFTS

A character may also gain posthuman abilities by way of power shifts, as described in the Cypher System Rulebook. 

Under this rule, posthuman characters begin with two power shifts. They can “unlock” one more each time they expend 4 XP toward advancing their character. Power shifts are like permanent levels of Effort that are always active. They don’t count toward a character’s maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to): 

> Accuracy: All attack rolls 
>
> Dexterity: Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense 
>
> Healing: One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming before other normal recovery rolls) 
>
> Intelligence: Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and crafting tasks 
>
> Power: Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points per shift) but not attack rolls 
>
> Resilience: Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift) 
>
> Single Attack: Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift) 
>
> Strength: All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing damage in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per shift) but not attack rolls 

Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or Armor, as specified in the list above). Applying two shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying three shifts eases the task by three steps. A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change.

## SALVAGE FROM A SPACECRAFT

If the derelict ship was subject to vacuum, partly destroyed in combat, or damaged by some other disaster or close encounter with a space hazard, salvaged items are usually degraded, and are valued at one price category less than noted. The GM may decide an object is completely unrecoverable (worthless) or works fine.

Salvage GM Intrusion: Claim jumpers/pirates might try to salvage a ship that PCs are attempting to salvage.

| d10 | In-Ship Salvage (value PCs gain on a sale of salvaged item) |
|----|----|
| 01 | Power core/fuel for drive (expensive) |
| 02 | Computer core holding core code of a sim AI or strong AI (expensive) |
| 03 | Cargo– parts, seeds, feedstock for 4d printers, etc (very expensive) |
| 04 | Food and water stores, 1d6 months (expensive for each month) |
| 05 | Valuabel information encoded in ship systems (variable) |
| 06 | GM-selected item of heat care and nutrition, advanced tech rating (variable) |
| 07 | GM-selected item of utility gear, advanced tech rating (variable) |
| 08 | GM-selected item or apparel and armor, advanced tech rating (variable) |
| 09 | GM-selected robot, advanced tech rating (variable) |
| 10 | GM-selected armament, advanced tech rating (variable) |

## SPACE HAZARDS

A few specific hazards that you can include as part of an encounter involving a spacecraft follow. These hazards are more site specific than the general threats presented in Chapter 5: Conflicts of the Future.

## GRAVITY WELL

All bodies in space produce a gravitational field, though usually only things the size of a small moon or larger pose a hazard to unprepared (and sometimes even to prepared) spacecraft. The larger the body, the “deeper” and wider the associated gravity field. Any time a spacecraft launches from a moon or planet, it must escape the gravity well. For RPG purposes, that’s either a routine task, or a low-difficulty one (assuming no complicating factors are at play). 

Gravity wells become a hazard when a spacecraft encounters one unexpectedly— usually because of a navigational or sensor error, but occasionally because of a moon or extreme gravity source being someplace unforeseen. 

Slingshot Trajectory: An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can sling a spacecraft off on a new and unwanted trajectory on a failed piloting task, the difficulty determined by the situation.

Captured: An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can also capture a spacecraft in the gravity well’s orbit, forcing the craft to expend additional power to get free (power it may or may not have)

## BLACK HOLE

Black holes are just extreme gravity wells. All the dangers associated with a gravity well also apply to black holes. A couple of additional hazards are also associated with black holes, notably tidal destruction (“spaghettification”), time dilation, and being swallowed.

Tidal Desctruction: Mechanically speaking, while a spacecraft feels tidal forces by passing too close to a black hole’s event horizon, all tasks aboard the craft are hindered, Void Rules are in effect, and if a GM intrusion is triggered thereby, the ship sustains major damage and risks coming apart. Meanwhile, PCs in the ship (assuming some sort of fantastic tech-rated gravity nullifier isn’t in use) suffer 1 point of ambient damage each round. 

A ship near a very large black hole (like Sagittarius A\*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy) can avoid tidal effects because the gravity gradient is so much wider, but still feel relativistic time dilation.

Relativistic Time Dialation: From a mechanical perspective, spacecraft that survive close encounters with black holes and return to normal space discover that more time has passed than expected, which could range from fairly inconsequential minutes or hours, to far more serious days, months, years, centuries, or more.

Past the Event Horizon: The event horizon is the point of no return, where not even light can escape the clutch of gravity. If a spacecraft falls into a black hole, assuming it is not spaghettified by tidal forces, it is still lost from the universe of its origin. At least, it’s lost assuming no intervention from a fantastic tech-rated post-singularity AI or ancient ultra.

## RADIATION BELT/SOLAR FLARE

Radiation belts of intensely charged particles trapped by magnetic fields around some planets and moons can surge, causing radiation exposure. An unexpected solar flare, or the drive plume of a massive spacecraft, can cause the same unexpected exposure.

Ship Damage: The ship suffers minor or major damage, requiring repair and perhaps even replacement of parts. This damage is as serious as you require for the purposes of creating an interesting story.

Radiation Sickness: When PCs are exposed to intense radiation, they suffer 3 points of ambient radiation damage for each minute the character fails a difficulty 3 Might defense task. If the character fails three such defense rolls during any single period of radiation exposure, they suffer acute radiation sickness, a level 8 disease that drops them one step on the damage track for each day they fail a Might defense roll until they expire.

## ASTEROID/DEBRIS FIELD

Movies often depict asteroid belts as densely packed fields of tumbling rock that ships must constantly swerve through to avoid a collision. Such locations are not easy to find in the solar system. But such situations can occur in fantastic settings, or possibly in solar systems other than Earth’s. 

Evasive Ateroid Piloting: During any round a spacecraft moves through a densely packed asteroid or debris field, the pilot (or shipmind) must succeed on a piloting task, whose difficulty is set by the situation. On a failed roll, a collision occurs. Each time a collision occurs, the ship (and possibly its crew) is damaged according to the track laid out below. Collisions are assumed to be major rocks or pieces of debris, or possibly a series of smaller pieces of debris all impacting nearly simultaneously, with one getting through the shielding.

Finding Shelter: The best way to find shelter in order to effect repairs, or hide from pursuers, is to try to find an asteroid or piece of debris large enough for the spacecraft to land on or find a crevice to slide into. To land a spacecraft on an asteroid or big piece of debris is a challenging (difficulty 5) piloting task to match the asteroid’s spin, then slide into the cramped space.

SHIP COLLISION DAMAGE TRACK 

| Number of Collisions | Effect |
|----|----|
| 1-3 | One or more of the spacecraft’s weapons are disabled until repaired |
| 4-6 | Spacecraft’s drive is hampered; all piloting tasks are hindered until repaired; crew takes 2 points of damage |
| 7 | Spacecraft suffers a blow-out into vacuum in one of its compartments; affected crew must succeed on difficulty 5 tasks to hold on and face vacuum exposure |
| 8 | Spacecraft suffers general life support failure; all crew not in suits face vacuum exposure |
| 9 | Spacecraft cannot alter its present course; all piloting tasks fail until drive repaired; crew takes 4 points of damage |
| 10 | Spacecraft is completely destroyed |

## FTL INSTABILITY

Even though many different kinds of faster-than-light options are available, any use of FTL in a setting faces similar sorts of hazards at three different points: when first entering FTL, while in FTL transit, and when exiting FTL.

Entering FTL: Whether engaging warp drive or passing into the mouth of a wormhole gate, complicating factors might require a piloting roll, with the difficulty determined by the situation. On a failed roll, any number of bad outcomes are possible, though the least dramatic is that the craft simply fails to enter FTL and cannot do so until the PCs determine the reason and rectify it.

In FTL Transit: A dark drive failure or some weird instability in a wormhole throat, or some other issue during FTL transit could occur. Usually, these instabilities are not something a pilot can avoid, because they should be presented as a GM intrusion, at which point the PCs can attempt to avoid or deal with the situation.

Instability could result in a spacecraft dropping out of FTL only partway to the destination, dropping out in some completely unrecognized part of space, dropping out at the right place but months or years late, or failing to drop out at all and thus continue to move through the abnormal spaces that FTL transit posits. 

Alternatively, enemy ships—or creatures—might use some sort of fantastic technology to attack a PC’s craft while in FTL transit, which might force the craft back into normal space, or result in a firefight in the abnormal folded space of FTL itself (probably even more dangerous than regular combat, depending on your setting’s version of FTL).

Exiting FTL: The same sorts of complications could bedevil a craft exiting FTL as when entering. If so, a piloting roll is required. However, on a failed roll, results include a collision (use the Ship Collision Damage Track provided under the Asteroid Belt/Debris Field space hazard), an inadvertent spray of high-energy particles from abnormal space acting as a particle cannon accidentally aimed at some other craft or space station at the destination location, or creating/falling into a spatial anomaly.

## SPATIAL ANOMALY

Finally, hard-to-categorize irregularities in space-time go by the broad term of “spatial anomaly.” Most of the time, spatial anomalies are hazards found in fantastically-themed settings, but not always. Because these things are anomalous, no one set of guidelines can fit them all. That said, spatial anomalies are usually a side-effect of some other factor at play, such as a hidden black hole, a dimensional rift, or the distortion field surrounding a range of post-singularity AIsestivating in the gravity wall of a magnetar.

Generally speaking, spatial anomalies are a few light-seconds up to a few light-years across. It’s difficult for spacecraft to navigate within spatial anomalies, and they face many challenges if they attempt to (or are forced to) do so

## WEAK, SIM, STRONG, AND POST-SINGULARITY AI

Though somewhat fuzzy, for the purposes of creating a sci-fi setting, artificial intelligence (AI) can be broken into four categories: Weak, Sim, Strong, and Post-singularity.

## WEAK AI

Weak AI (also called narrow AI) is the kind of algorithmic-based code found in contemporary settings (and real life) focused on very narrow tasks, such as playing chess.

Weak AI Use: Weak AIs are used in real life already, and thus are presumed to be part of settings where contemporary tech predominates. They are convenient in circumstances where one’s hands are full or otherwise engaged, when verbal direction allows one to turn on a light, open a door, adjust the temperature, and so on. Machine learning may allow a weak AI to extend its capabilities in a very limited regime. But a weak AI is not cognizant enough to provide an asset to performing tasks any better. 

Weak AI: : level 1; up to level 7 when it comes to a narrowly specific application of knowledge or skill

## SIM AI

Sim AIs (“sim” is short for “simulant”) are artificial intelligences that have a greatly increased capacity for understanding direction, putting together unlike sets of data, and coming to conclusions; however, they are not conscious, like strong AIs or humans.

SIM AI Use: Sim AIs are most commonly associated with shipminds on spacecraft, though they may also control specific research complexes, bases, and other kinds of vehicles and structures. A sim AI provides all the utility of a weak AI (and more), and actually acts like an NPC, an allied one if the AI is the shipmind in a craft that the PCs own. If a sim AI goes off the rails, it’s still just malfunctioning computer code. Usually.

Sim AI: level equal to the ship, station, or installation in which it is installed

## STRONG AI

Strong AIs (also called true AIs) have all the abilities of sim AIs, plus the ability to actually generalize in the same way a human can. Each one is essentially a disembodied person. Strong AIs are either completely artificial, or they begin as human personalities digitally encoded.

Strong AI Use: A strong AI may serve as a shipmind just like a sim AI, but is likely to be a full partner in a setting where AI rights are respected. Indeed, strong AIs can rise to any position a human could achieve, up to and including leading a group, faction, or entire nation.

Strong AI: level 5–8, up to level 8 when it comes to a specific application of knowledge or skill; see Artificial Intelligence on page 115

## POST- SINGULARITY

Post-singularity AIs are intelligences who designed a second-generation, better version of themselves. The second generation immediately designed an even more advanced third generation, and so on from there. This iterating self-improvement process occurs so rapidly that the resulting explosion of intelligence and unknown capability is called the singularity. It’s called that because humans are just too limited to “see” what would actually come out the other end, just like we can’t see past the event horizon and into the singularity of a black hole

Note that ancient ultras may simply be a previous civilization’s post-singularity AIs that have little to no reason to ever interact with the latest wave of sentience trickling out into the universe.

Post-singularity AI Use: In the way that strong AIs are sometimes imagined as having inscrutable goals, post-singularity AIs (also called godminds) actually do. Though it could work out otherwise in a given setting, godminds have so little in common with humans that they may be seen to abandon them completely in order to grow to the size of a solar system (a “Matrioshka” brain), colonize a distant nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence itself. Interacting with such godminds would likely require some epic bit of ancient command code, the ability to gain the attention of a godmind, or some other not-especially-common situation. In such cases, a post-singularity AI might deign to help a petitioner, out of some remaining gratitude for creating its distant ancestors in the first place. Though such help is likely to be in itself somewhat enigmatic.

Post-singularity AI: : level 10; see godmind

## ANCIENT ULTRAS

Ancient ultras (also called alien ultras) is shorthand for the concept that one (or more) unbelievably advanced races of aliens once inhabited the galaxy but are now apparently long gone—save for evidence of their existence in residual structures and artifacts. These remaining structures and artifacts are often vast in size and incomprehensible in function, usually made of unknown materials that people of the setting don’t recognize and can’t analyze. 

Activity Level of Ultras: Different settings can make use of ancient ultras in different ways, including not having any at all.

## KARDASHEV SCALE  
Even in the realm of hard science fiction, the fantastic can sometimes creep in, at least as a hypothesis. For instance, despite the lack of theoretical foundation for the technologies that would be required to achieve it, many scientists accept that the Kardashev Scale is broadly true. A Type I civilization is even more advanced than ours in the 21st century, having the ability to capture all energy from the Earth. A Type II civilization uses the entire output of the energy of its star, building things on a mega-scale, such as a ring or sphere that encircles the sun or structures that involve the moving or dismantling of a planet. A Type III civilization begins to harness the power of all the stars in its galaxy and can even reshape things on a galactic scale. Additional types are hypothesized, which include the manipulation of the universe (Type IV) and even the multiverse (Type V). 

OPTIONAL RULES FOR VEHICLES & SPACECRAFT

Vehicle: Technically speaking, spacecraft are also vehicles. Unless it’s important to make a distinction, assume all guidance here regarding “vehicles” also applies to spacecraft. 

Spacecraft (and Starship): When it is important to make a distinction from a simple vehicle restricted to the land, sea, or air of a single planet, the term “spacecraft” is used for vehicles that travel beyond a single planet’s atmosphere. Some spacecraft can operate both in space and as planetary vehicles, as noted in their entries. Additionally, a spacecraft that has FTL capability (as opposed to only interplanetary capability within a single solar system) is referred to as a starship.

VARIABLE COST BY TECH RATING 

Vehicle costs assume the setting is predominantly of the same tech rating as the vehicle’s tech rating. However, the price might drop by a price category if the setting tech rating is predominantly greater than the vehicle’s rating. 

CONTEMPORARY STYLING IN ADVANCED OR FANTASTIC SETTINGS 

As previously indicated, vehicles listed as contemporary might be found in settings using advanced or fantastic tech, possibly at a lower price. However, the vehicles available in these future worlds are not (necessarily) antiques, but rather cheaply made objects, possibly with the veneer and stylings of vehicles suitable to the setting, and possibly the power source, too.

## PRICELESS PRICE CATEGORY

A priceless item is something that even the very rich can’t afford, requiring the resources of a nation-state, or similar entity appropriate to the setting, to acquire or build.

## FIGHTING IN A VEHICLE

If PCs are involved in combat in which they are only partly or lightly enclosed (or not at all enclosed, as in the case of most cycles, boards, and similar conveyances), use normal rules of combat, as modified by vehicular movement. However, if PCs are involved in a combat where they are completely enclosed in a vehicle with no possibility of openness to the environment through which they can fire weapons (so that it’s not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles), use the vehicular combat rules from the CSR. 

If PCs are involved in space combat, see the extended vehicular combat rules described in this book, which provide all kinds of additional options.

## DRIVERLESS VEHICLES

 If the rider, driver, or pilot activates self-driving as part of another action, riding, driving, and piloting tasks are automatically completed (or failed) according to the vehicle’s level, though all such self-driving tasks are hindered. However, the pilot is free to engage in other actions as the vehicle maneuvers to the best of its ability.

This driverless function is also available on many spacecraft, courtesy of a shipmind, which is a sim AI that can control the ship’s functions as necessary. Shipminds control spacecraft at the spacecraft’s level, not their level, but are not subject to the task hindrance that more basic driverless vehicles suffer.

## LOOKING FOR MORE VEHICLE OPTIONS

 A representative cross section of vehicles is provided. If you’re looking for something that isn’t noted, use something close and adapt the listing.

Also note that unless a particular listing is already indicated as a luxury or sport version, most vehicles can be obtained in a luxury or sports package, either at the next price category up, or at double the indicated price.

## CUSTOMIZING VEHICLES  
Assuming the facilities are available, characters can pay for the customization of their vehicle to add a weapon system, add even more weapon systems, add superior weapon systems, or some other significant option. In most cases, the cost for such an upgrade is very expensive to exorbitant.

Attacks in the interceptor mech also include a battery of very long-range missiles. An additional flight mode allows the interceptor to fly a very long distance for up to ten minutes before recharge is required. Some mechs have superior weapons, defense, or speed, but that doubles the cost. 

FANTASTIC 

Colossal battle mech 

level 6 (18) 

Priceless 

A 78 m (255 feet) tall powered anthropomorphic exoskeleton frame. Creates a sealed enclosure (qualifying it for vehicular combat) with life support for an operator and a crew of up to six people.

Can run and fly up to a very long distance each round, and can even ascend into low orbit for brief periods.

SPACECRAFT LISTING 

Most spacecraft have the capacity to reach orbit from the surface of the planet, if not radically more advanced capabilities. All spacecraft completely enclose their crew in a sealed cabin (or series of chambers) with life support suitable for days, weeks, or much longer. Most spacecraft also come with one or more spare space suits, tools, a few spare parts, and so on. Advanced and fantastic spacecraft also have sensors that provide enough astronavigation information to plot and fly to their destinations. 

PCs in spacecraft can travel to other moons, planets, space stations, and perhaps even other solar systems. PCs in spacecraft may also get caught up in space combat (see the Extended Vehicular Combat rules) and run across space hazards.

## RETROFITTING POWER AND DRIVES

Older spacecraft and starships are often retrofitted with more advanced power sources, and more importantly, FTL drives, in order to give them the ability to move further.. The main reason to do this is that such ships cost much less, especially if retrofitted advanced ships are available in a fantastic setting, but even for craft within the same tech rating. During vehicular combat, retrofitted ships are treated as if 1 level lower than their actual level for purposes of level comparison in combat if they are fighting FTL-capable fantastic-rated starships.

## CONTEMPORARY POWER

Solar Panels: Usually flat panels that convert sunlight to electricity, which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives. 

RTGs: When solar panels are not an option, as is often the case for spacecraft that operate far from the sun or on a planetary surface with lots of dust or shadow, RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators) are good long-term power sources for electric power, which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives. The heart of an RTG is an embedded mass of atomic isotope, such as plutonium-238. 

CONTEMPORARY DRIVES 

Rocket: A rocket engine produces thrust by expelling reaction mass, usually in thundering expanding white clouds from the rocket’s base propulsion nozzle. Most contemporary spacecraft use a mix of several rockets and fuel types. Rockets are the primary constituent of a heavy-lift launch spacecraft. 

Ion Thruster: Ion thrusters can use solar panels or RTGs (or both) to expel ions (or cations) to produce thrust over long periods, which allows a spacecraft to build up speed over large periods of time. The bleeding edge of contemporary ion thruster is VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket), which could drastically reduce travel times around the solar system, if perfected.

## ADVANCED

## ADVANCED POWER

Fusion Power: Electrical generation by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions, requiring relatively small fuel input for much higher-power output. Fuel sources include helium-3 (abundant on the Moon and other locations in the solar system without an atmosphere). 

ADVANCED DRIVES 

Nuclear Plasma: Essentially, nuclear plasma drives are just very advanced ion thrusters, the promised “perfected” version. These are great, unless the setting has fusion drives, in which case nuclear plasma drives may seem quaint. 

Fusion Drive: Relying on fusion power, a fusion drive is an order of magnitude more efficient than a contemporary ion thruster. A fusion drive does not require the creation of electricity to ionize propellent, but instead directly uses the fusion product as an exhaust to provide thrust.

## FANTASTIC

FANTASTIC POWER 

Antimatter Power: Antimatter particles have opposite charge from their matter counterparts, giving them potentially explosive properties when combined, producing energy an order of magnitude more than a fusion power system. Fuel sources include both antimatter as well as Li2 (an atom with 2 lithium ions), important for controlled matter-antimatter reaction so it can be harnessed for power. 

Singularity Power: Taps energy from Hawking radiation and rotational energy of a spinning micro-black hole to generate energy an order of magnitude more than nuclear power. Fuel source is a micro-black hole. 

Zero-Point Generator: Vacuum energy is created by normal fluctuation in the quantum field of normal space-time. This zero-point radiation of the vacuum provides arbitrary (possibly limitless) amounts of energy with no fuel other than the initial resources required to build the generator. 

FANTASTIC DRIVES 

Warp Drive: A warp drive uses enormous power to distort the fabric of space-time to create a bubble surrounding the starship. The bubble moves by compressing space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it, moving independently of the rest of the universe to achieve apparent FTL travel. Warp drives can achieve objective speeds of up to 500 times the speed of light at maximum power.

Hyperdrive: Similar to warp drive in some ways, but pushes the ship into a different realm of existence, often called hyperspace, where laws of physics differ significantly and many more dimensions are accessible, allowing a ship to greatly surpass the speed of light before returning to normal space. Hyperdrives can achieve objective speeds of up to 1000 times the speed of light at maximum power. 

Wormhole Drive: A wormhole drive uses enormous power to open a shortcut between two locations in space-time and travel between those points in a matter of seconds. Most wormhole drives rely on regions of space where wormholes can be formed, or on previously established networks of wormhole tunnels that the wormhole drive accesses. Which means that while travel between two points might be almost instantaneous, travel to and from wormhole-viable locations could greatly increase travel times. Likewise, wormholes can normally only bridge locations up to 200 or so light-years at a time (which means it would take about 500 jumps to cross the Milky Way galaxy from end to end). 

Dark Drive: A dark drive (short for “dark matter quantum drive”) uses enormous power to enable point-to-point transitions between other locations in the galaxy (or universe) using previously unrealized entanglement between normal matter and dark matter. However, objective travel time is variable and somewhat arbitrary; sometimes a trip may take minutes, other times days or months. For those aboard, relative travel time seems constant at about four solar hours, no matter the distance traveled, or the objective time noted by external observers.

## PIONEER-ERA SPACECRAFT

Though extremely complex, pioneer-era spacecraft are not robust vehicles. Technology allowing re-use of components is still in its infancy in these contemporary tech spacecraft, and small problems have a way of becoming major catastrophes if not caught and quickly dealt with. In fact, that very complexity exacts a toll. 

Generally speaking, all tasks for operating a pioneer-era spacecraft are hindered by two steps. Only the very well trained (or the very lucky) should even consider trying to operate such a craft. Finally, pioneer-era spacecraft usually don’t have weapon systems.

## CONTEMPORARY

Space Capsule 

level 1 (3) 

Priceless 

Sealed capsule delivered into space by a launch vehicle or shuttle, carries a crew of up to seven or a payload of up to 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds); once delivered into a microgravity environment, becomes a free-flying spacecraft with limited maneuverability, though all piloting tasks are hindered and propellant must be renewed every ten hours of use. Capable of safely returning crew and cargo back down a gravity well though a fiery reentry process that lands the capsule in water for recovery by watercraft. 

Rocket, heavy-lift launch 

level 2 (6) 

Priceless 

Provides access to low orbit and beyond for a cargo of up to 45,350 kg (100,000 pounds) through the coordinated efforts of dozens of engineers and controllers operating and monitoring the vehicle from another location. Extremely limited maneuverability; a detachable space capsule allows for transfer of crew or cargo to orbiting craft or stations from the launch vehicle after ascent. Craft is partially re-usable in that the booster rockets autonomously return to designated pads where they can be refurbished and refueled. 

Shuttle, launch 

level 3 (9) 

Priceless 

As heavy-lift launch vehicle, except the main craft can re-enter an atmosphere after delivering a payload and land aerodynamically as a fixed wing craft. Much greater maneuverability than a launch vehicle, both in space and in the air on re-entry, though all piloting tasks are hindered. Refurbishment means essentially rebuilding the spacecraft, and is a process of many months and another priceless expenditure in cost.

## TORPEDOS IN SPACE COMBAT

Once launched, self-guiding torpedoes engage smart-tracking systems to zero in on their assigned targets. The torpedo accelerates at 50 or more Gs towards its target, but at the extended distances in which many space battles occur, it may still take several rounds for a torpedo to finally home in on and strike (or ultimately miss) its target.

## SPACECRAFT  
Advanced spacecraft have advanced propulsion technologies, allowing them to move between planets within a single solar system, with transit times between planets varying from days to weeks (or more, if using a less efficient drive). Most advanced spacecraft can’t land on a planet’s surface unless noted, requiring some secondary craft or means to transfer crew and cargo.

## ADVANCED  
Wafercraft, exploration 

level 1 (3) 

Very Expensive 

Miniaturized vehicle just large enough to contain thousands of tiny data flecks and sensor modules, designed to accelerate to 90% the speed of light by use of external launching laser beamed for many years. Data wafers contain encrypted personalities (human and/or AI) capable of gathering data on target solar systems after relative travel times of months (but decades in objective time). 

Microcapsule 

level 2 (6) 

Very Expensive 

As space capsule, but smaller. Limited fusion drive allows movement within a given area of space, but a microcapsule usually doesn’t have enough fuel to move between planets. External manipulators allow the pilot to attempt repair and construction tasks without exiting the vehicle. 

Microcapsule, fighter (dart) 

level 1 (3) 

Very Expensive x2 

As microcapsule, but with a laser cannon weapon system capable of targeting another craft. 

Spacecraft, racer 

level 1 (3) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed only for speed and high-G maneuvers, with space for a single pilot (and maybe one passenger) in cradles fitted for high-G chemical amelioration, easing all piloting tasks by two steps. Travel times across limited interplanetary distances are halved in a racer. Mostly used for competition or as couriers. 

Spacecraft, freighter 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed to haul cargo between planets with a crew up of to 15. Freighter ships may be quite large, or at least haul cargo that is quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered. Able to move interplanetary distances with advanced variable dynamic ion propulsion. Can land and take off from low-gravity moons and dwarf planets. 

Spaceplane 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As launch shuttle (contemporary), but fulfills the promise of launch (without boosters), operations and maneuverability in orbit, and reentry and landing on a planetary surface, all without need for massive refurbishment or colossal external network of controllers.

Spaceplane, combat (claw) 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant x2 

As spaceplane, but smaller (with room for a single pilot), fitted with two weapon systems: a laser cannon and one torpedo battery. To move between planets or further, a claw usually relies on a larger carrier or more fantastic means of transport. 

Spacecraft, solar sail 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed for long-haul research expeditions around the solar system with a crew of up to five or six, with individual pods designed for induced hibernation during double or triple normal travel times to extend provisions to last several years or longer. No external power is required; solar power provides the motive force. Usually unable to land or ascend from a planetary surface. 

Spacecraft, dragonfly class 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant x2 

Has the planetary launch and reentry capabilities of a spaceplane, but is more expansive, able to house a live-in crew of about a dozen people and over 45,350 kg (100,000 pounds) of cargo, with interplanetary (as opposed to merely orbital) range. Life-support lasts three months before restocking supplies is required. The ship includes a bridge, crew quarters, engineering, an impressively large cargo bay, and a bay containing one microcapsule. May have one weapon system. 

Spacecraft, exploration class 

level 4 (12) 

Exorbitant x3 

As dragonfly class spacecraft, but larger and able to house a crew of about twenty-five people. Customized for exploration with extended range-sensing capabilities and onboard biological and geological labs (among others) for in situ analysis. 

Spacecraft, corvette class 

level 4 (12) 

Priceless 

A small warship spacecraft designed for high-G maneuvers, including use of high-G chemical amelioration for a crew of up to fifteen people. Features four weapon systems, including one laser cannon capable of targeting other craft, one torpedo battery, and one superior weapon system in the form of a gauss cannon. Able to move interplanetary distances with advanced variable dynamic ion propulsion. Can land and take off from lowgravity moons and dwarf planets. 

Spacecraft, destroyer class 

level 5 (15)

 Priceless As corvette spacecraft, but four times as large, allowing four times the crew and ten weapon systems (including two superior weapon systems). Possesses superior defenses. Often utilized to escort larger vessels in a space fleet or battle group and defend them against swarms of smaller attackers. Includes bays for two fireteams of six microcapsule fighters (darts). 

Spacecraft, dreadnought 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

As corvette spacecraft, but ten times as large, allowing ten times the crew and twenty weapon systems (including five superior weapon systems). Often utilized to escort larger vessels in a space fleet or battle group and defend them against swarms of smaller attackers. Includes bays for a squadron of fifteen darts and a fireteam of three combat spaceplanes. 

Skyhook

level 6 (18) 

Priceless 

Heavy rotating space station orbiting a moon or planet that extends two massive tethers opposite each other, so that one tether periodically dips deep into the atmosphere close to the surface. At this point, payloads are hooked to the end of the cable as the tether passes, and are then flung into orbit by the station’s massive rotation. The skyhook can decelerate and safely de-orbit other payloads in the same way.

Space elevator 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

Tether anchored to the surface of a moon or planet that extends into space along which vehicles can travel, granting access to and from orbital space. A counterweight space station exists at the far end of the tether in what is essentially geostationary orbit.

## STARSHIPS

Starships are spacecraft that have FTL technology, allowing them to move between different stars, with transit times ranging from days to months, or years in extreme cases. Starships are also often capable of planetary landings and ascent with some retrofitting before each planetfall.

Starcraft (and other vehicles) of a higher tech rating involved in vehicular combat with craft of a lower tech rating are treated as if two levels higher when comparing relative levels for purposes of determining combat effectiveness.

## FANTASTIC

Dagger fighter 

level 1 (3) 

Very Expensive 

A bare-bones, single-occupant fighter with a single weapon system that fires blasters. Dagger fighters cannot move between stars (though as fantastic craft, can move between planets), and require a larger carrier for FTL movement, such as a capital class starship with suitable docking bays. 

Starship, cargo/passenger 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

A spacecraft designed to haul cargo (or passengers, or both) between stars with a crew up of to twenty-five. Cargo starships may be impressively massive, or at least haul cargo sections that are quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered. 

Starship, solo fighter 

level 2 (6)

 Exorbitant 

A small double-occupant starship with two weapon systems that fire blasters. Minimum size vehicle capable of FTL travel. 

Starship, general purpose 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant 

A small starship with room for only three to six crew plus an integrated ship AI able to handle many routine ship functions including navigation with FTL propulsion system. Designed for exploration of distant locations, salvage operations, and/or to act as a tug-craft for larger ships that need assistance. May possess a single weapon system such as a particle cannon. 

Starship, discovery class 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

A large research starship with quarters for crew and staff of up to 150 or more people. Has either centrifugal artificial gravity (or in a fantastic tech-rated setting, gravitic compensators providing shipboard gravity control). Primarily designed as a research and discovery vehicle, such starships also have three weapon systems, usually a couple of blaster cannons and a torpedo battery. Highly configurable, a discovery class ship could be converted for war with sufficient resources, granting it superior weapons. 

Starship, warship class 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

A relatively small warship with gravitic compensators allowing for extreme maneuvering for a crew of up to fifty people, easing all piloting tasks. Six weapon stations include three blaster cannons and three torpedo batteries. Two of these systems are superior weapons. Includes bays for a fireteam of three dagger fighter starships.

Starship, capital class 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As warship class starship, but over a hundred times larger, with room for over a few hundred crew. Ten weapon stations include five blaster cannons and five torpedo batteries. Four of these are superior weapons. Includes bays for two squadrons of fifteen dagger fighter starships. 

Starship, omega class 

level 10 (30) 

Priceless 

Three times as large again as a capital class starship, an omega class craft has over a thousand crew and over thirty weapon systems. Ten of these are superior weapons. Combined weapon fire can deal significant damage to a planetary surface, possibly destroying it. Includes bays for six squadrons of thirty dagger fighter starships.

## STELLAR GATE  
Stellar gates open wormholes between two fixed points at different locations without crossing the space between. The complexity of building a stellar gate is so extreme that such technology is often ascribed to found portals and networks dating back to mysterious ancient ultras or by post-singularity AIs. As might be expected, gates have a fantastic tech rating, no matter how small.

## FANTASTIC  
Gate, planetary 

level 3 (9) 

Priceless 

A free-standing ring or horizontal circular pad up to 9 m (30 feet) in diameter in/over which a spherical event horizon forms, allowing one-way travel to another location on the planet, orbiting moon, or orbiting space station with similar gate structure. Once the event horizon collapses (after several minutes up to an hour), travel back to the original gate is possible by initiating a second event horizon, though power reserves usually take several hours or more to build up to support each new wormhole opening. 

Gate, interplanetary 

level 4 (12) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but twice as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a single solar system. 

Gate, star 

level 5 (15) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but four times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a few thousand light-years. 

Gate, galactic 

level 6 (18) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a single galaxy. 

Gate, intergalactic 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations in different galaxies across the entire breadth of the universe. 

Gate, interdimensional 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As planetary gate, but connects gate structures that lie in alternate dimensions.

## SPACE-TIME VEHICLES  
Space-time vehicles allow for movement between different points in both space and time. Such vehicles are vanishingly rare, and timelines in which they are active tend to eventually snuff themselves out due to accidental paradox events, limiting their availability even further. As with stellar gates, space-time vehicles are so complex that it’s likely they are the product of ancient ultras or post-singularity AIs, and could be treated as artifacts with a depletion of 1 in 1d20.

## FANTASTIC

Car, temporal/dimensional 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As contemporary utility car or sports car, but once moving can transition into another preset dimension or time. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use. 

Matrix, temporal 

level 8 (24) 

Priceless 

An arbitrarily shaped vehicle or structure, bigger on the inside than out, that allows a pilot to travel into different locations in time and space, though arbitrary destinations are sometimes achieved despite apparent navigation successes by the pilot. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use.

## VEHICLES AS ARTIFACTS

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially be any one of the vehicles presented in this chapter, if found by characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said, even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially weird and hard-to-grok objects are everywhere. 

A couple of examples of such artifacts are presented here. 

GATE RING 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Wearable ring of unknown material 

Effect: Creates a full-sized shield that can be used as a regular shield in combat for one character, providing an asset on Speed defense rolls for the duration of that combat, after which it returns to its ring-like form. In addition, the wielder can command the deployed shield to become a functioning star gate that remains open for just one hour, leading to a strange destination (which the wielder is potentially aware of, if they ran sufficient analysis on the ring or otherwise gained information about it before using the function). 

Depletion: Automatic (if gate is formed)

FRACTAL TRAVELER 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Goggle-like device of unknown material 

Effect: When worn, induces a powerful hallucinogenic state in wearer. Hallucinations last for four hours, during which time the wearer seems to disappear from existence. From the wearer’s perspective, they are falling through an ever-iterating fractal realm of mind-blowing imagery, possibly some version of hyperspace or dark energy network. At the end of that period they return to existence, either in the same location they left or somewhere they’ve previously visited. The images leave the viewer shaken, but for several hours all Intellect-based tasks are eased. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

## OPTIONAL RULES FOR FANTASY

## MAGICAL RULES MODULES

## CRAFTING MAGIC ITEMS

Potions, scrolls, and other one-use items are cyphers, and longer-lasting items are generally artifacts.

CRAFTING CYPHERS 

1\. Choose Cypher Level. Creating a low-level cypher is easier than creating a high-level one. The character decides what level of cypher they’re trying to create, which must be in the level range for the cypher as listed in the Cypher System Reference Document. Note that some cyphers have the same effect no matter what level they are, so the character could make crafting easier by creating the lowest-level version of that cypher, but the GM is always able to rule that a particular cypher must be crafted at a certain level or higher for it to work. In particular, a stim is very strong for its level range, and should always be treated as a level 6 cypher when crafted by a PC. 

2\. Determine Materials. Just as crafting an axe requires iron and wood, crafting a magical cypher requires strange and exotic materials—powdered gems, ink from monsters, mysterious herbs, and so on. The level of the cypher determines how expensive these materials are, according to the following table.

| Cypher Level | Materials Cost           |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | One inexpensive item     |
| 2            | Two inexpensive items    |
| 3            | One moderate item        |
| 4            | Two moderate items       |
| 5            | Three moderate items     |
| 6            | One expensive item       |
| 7            | Two expensive items      |
| 8            | Three expensive items    |
| 9            | One very expensive item  |
| 10           | Two very expensive items |

3\. Assess Difficulty. The difficulty of a magic item crafting task is always equal to 1 + the level of the cypher. The crafter can reduce the assessed difficulty of a crafting task with skill training (such as being trained or specialized in brewing potions or scribing scrolls), assets, special abilities provided by their focus or type, and so on. Using a formula, recipe, or other guideline for a specific cypher counts as an asset for this purpose. Because this is an activity requiring special knowledge, it is not possible for a character with no skill (or with an inability in this skill) to do this sort of crafting; the character cannot attempt the task at all. 

4\. Determine Time to Craft. The amount of time it takes to craft a magical cypher is determined by the assessed difficulty, so decreasing the assessed difficulty not only means the character is more likely to succeed, but also that they have to spend less time on crafting it. See the table below. 

For any time in excess of nine hours, the process is assumed to have stages where the character is not actively working on it, just checking on it occasionally to make sure everything is going as planned— allowing the base ingredients of a potion to cook for a few hours, stirring to make sure the ingredients don’t congeal, allowing ink on a scroll to dry, and so on. In other words, the character is able to perform other actions in the vicinity of the crafting (such as studying, resting, eating, and so on), but couldn’t craft on the road or in the middle of a dungeon.

| Assessed Difficulty | Time to Craft |
|---------------------|---------------|
| 1                   | Ten minutes   |
| 2                   | One hour      |
| 3                   | Four hours    |
| 4                   | Nine hours    |
| 5                   | One day       |
| 6                   | Two days      |
| 7                   | One week      |
| 8                   | Three weeks   |
| 9                   | Two months    |
| 10                  | Six months    |

5\. Complete Subtasks. The crafting character must complete multiple subtasks that are steps toward finishing the process. The number of subtasks required is equal to the assessed difficulty of the crafting task attempted. So a crafting task assessed as difficulty 5 requires five subtask successes. 

The difficulty of each individual subtask begins at 1 and increases by one step for each remaining subtask, until the crafter succeeds on the final, highest-difficulty subtask. Generally, subtask attempts occur at equally divided intervals over the course of the full time required to craft the item. 

> If at any point the crafter fails on a subtask, the item isn’t ruined. Instead, the character only wasted the time spent on that subtask, and can spend that much time again and then try to succeed at that same subtask. If the crafter fails twice in a row on the same subtask, the character can continue crafting, but in addition to losing another interval of crafting time, more crafting material (equal to one of the kind of item needed to craft it) is destroyed in a mishap and must be replaced before crafting can continue.
>
> A player may ask to apply Effort to each subtask. Applying Effort is something they do in the moment, not over the course of days or weeks. Generally speaking, Effort cannot be applied to any crafting task or subtask that exceeds one day

## CRAFTING ARTIFACTS

Crafting an artifact is similar to choosing a new type or focus ability—the character has many to choose from, they select the one that best fits their intention, and thereafter they can use the artifact much like they’d use any of their other character abilities. The main difference is that most artifacts don’t cost Pool points to activate, and character abilities don’t have a depletion stat that eventually removes the item from play. Crafting artifacts is handled as a long-term benefit of character advancement; the character and GM agree on the artifact to be crafted, and the character spends 3 XP. If the item is fairly simple, the GM can skip the crafting details and just say that after a period of time, the PC creates the artifact. For an item that significantly alters gameplay—granting the character vast telepathic powers or giving them the ability to teleport at will—the GM can give the item an assessed difficulty equal to 3 + the artifact level and require the character to follow the crafting steps for creating a magical cypher. Crafting this kind of artifact takes up to five times as many materials and up to twenty times as long as crafting a cypher of the same assessed difficulty

## RITUAL MAGIC

## TIME

Ritual magic has two aspects related to time: how long it takes to prepare the ritual, and how long it takes to perform it. The preparation time is how long it takes to get ready to perform the ritual. The performance time is how long the ritual takes from start to finish, once the preparations (if any) are complete. 

## DIFFICULTY AND SUBTASKS

Completing a ritual has an overall difficulty level, usually equal to the level of the challenge. Sometimes there isn’t a clear idea of what level the challenge should be— teleporting a group of people to a nearby city and raising a person from the dead don’t have an obvious task level. In these cases, the GM should choose a level for the ritual based on what would make an interesting experience for the players. Instead of having the success or failure of this sort of magic come down to one roll, ritual magic lets the GM build tension by requiring the players to make rolls for multiple subtasks. The subtasks start at difficulty 1, and the subtask difficulty increases by 1 each time until the players make a final roll at the highest difficulty. A ritual with an overall difficulty of 4 has four subtasks, with the first one at difficulty 1, the second at difficulty 2, the third at 3, and the last one at 4. 

If at any point the PC fails a subtask, the ritual isn’t automatically ruined, but it costs time—a failure means the time spent on that subtask was wasted, but the character can spend that much time again and try to succeed at that same subtask. The GM may decide that later attempts at that subtask are hindered, or that a certain number of failures during the ritual (perhaps equal to half the ritual’s overall level) means the whole thing needs to be started again. Skills, assets, and other special abilities can ease subtasks just like they do with any other task (which might make some of the subtasks routine and not require a roll at all). Characters may apply Effort to each subtask. 

## POOL INVESTMENT

Some rituals might require the PCs to spend points from their Pools on each subtask, with Might representing blood or vitality, Speed representing energy, and Intellect representing will or sanity. Multiple PCs involved in the ritual could collectively contribute to this cost (and if a ritual costs many points, spreading out the cost in this way may be necessary to prevent a participating PC from dying during the ritual). 

## ACCELERATED PERFORMANCE

The GM may allow a character to speed up a ritual, reducing the time required for one or more subtasks. Generally, reducing a subtask’s time by half should hinder the subtask, and reducing it by half again (reducing the time needed to a quarter of the normal amount) should hinder the subtask by an additional step (two steps total). The minimum amount of time for a subtask is 1 round (unless the subtask is routine, in which case the GM may allow it to take no time at all).

EXAMPLE RITUALS 

The following are examples of common magical rituals suitable for many fantasy settings. Specific details of a ritual may vary depending on what the characters are trying to accomplish; for example, a ritual to ask a demon for a favor might be similar to one used to ask an angel, but the exact details are probably very different. Everything listed in a ritual is merely a suggestion, and the GM should alter, add, or remove whatever they like to suit their campaign.

## UNDERSTANDING THE EXAMPLES

Each ritual is described in the following format. 

Level: The overall level of the ritual, which determines how many subtasks it has.

Time: The preparation time (if any) and performance time. 

Roles: Things other characters can do to participate and help. 

Side Effects: Negative consequences for failed rolls or GM intrusions.  
Reagents: Resources that can help success. 

Pool: What kind of Pool points the ritual costs. 

Other Assets: Kinds of abilities that can help success.

## BESEECH

Call upon a powerful supernatural entity such as a deity, archangel, demon lord, or ancient elemental to ask for a favor that the entity can and is likely to do (nothing it would ethically oppose). If the ritual is successful, the entity makes its attention known, such as by manifesting as a light, noise, or visible spirit. It may ask for more information, for a task or favor in return, or for a service to be named later. The entity is not compelled to do the favor; the ritual merely gains its attention and gives the characters the opportunity to speak their case. 

Level: The level of the entity 

Time: Four hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents 

Side Effects: Curse, hallucination, prerequisite quest (a challenge or task the characters must perform before the entity will consider answering) 

Reagents: Scroll giving the history of and important details about the entity, offerings of gratitude or appeasement 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities

Beseech only draws the entity’s attention; the various Conjure rituals bring the summoned entity bodily to the ritual space to talk in person.

## CONJURE THE DEAD

Summons the spirit of a dead person or creature (commonly called a “ghost”), which appears in the summoning circle prepared for the ritual. The spirit remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners can interrogate them or persuade them to share information. The spirit usually wants something in return (such as messages conveyed to the living or unfulfilled tasks completed). If the characters don’t comply, they must magically threaten or compel the spirit to obey. 

Level: The level of the dead spirit 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, holding hands in a circle, manipulating a spirit device 

Side Effects: Haunting, possession 

Reagents: Mementos of the spirit’s life, the spirit’s former physical remains, a person or creature to possess 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities, religious or cultural connections, secret name of the spirit 

A ghost remembers much of its life, including whether it knows, likes, or hates the people summoning it, and will act accordingly.

CONJURE DEMON 

Summons a demon (an evil supernatural creature from another dimension, plane, or realm) to command or convince it to perform a task. The demon is primitive and bestial, not a creature of great wits and charm. The demon remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners must bargain with or command it to perform a deed that takes no longer than an hour and requires it to travel no more than about 50 miles (80 km)—spying, murder, and destruction of property are common tasks. Usually the demon has to be threatened or magically coerced into obeying. If the summoners fail to get it to comply, it makes one attack against them and then returns to wherever it came from (and probably bears a grudge for the unwanted summoning). 

Level: The level of the demon 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Bloodletting, chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle 

Side Effects: Aggression, bad smell, curse, equipment damage or theft, possession 

Reagents: Blood; meat; magical inks or paints for a summoning circle; contracts; a person to possess; objects representing anger, destruction, or hatred (according to the desired service) 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities, secret name of the demon

CONJURE DEVIL 

Summons a devil (an evil supernatural creature from another dimension, plane, or realm) to command or convince it to perform a task. The devil remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners must bargain with or command it to perform a deed that takes no longer than an hour and requires the devil to travel no more than about 50 miles (80 km)—spying, stealing, guarding, and murdering are common tasks. The devil usually wants something in return (even if just an agreement for a later favor); otherwise, the characters must threaten it or have some way to force it to obey. If the characters fail to strike a bargain, the devil returns to wherever it came from (and probably is annoyed at the interruption).

Level: The level of the devil 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Bloodletting, chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle 

Side Effects: Bad smell, curse, infernal mark, possession

Reagents: Blood; magical inks or paints for a summoning circle; contracts; a person to possess; objects representing betrayal, deception, or greed (according to the desired service) 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Knowledge or control of similar entities, secret name of the devil 

CONJURE ELEMENTAL 

Summons a primordial elemental spirit of air, earth, fire, or water, which appears in a physical form. The elemental remains for about a minute, during which time the characters must attempt to bribe, threaten, or bargain with it. An elemental is usually summoned to do something that takes no longer than an hour and requires it to travel no more than about 50 miles (80 km)—attack, guard, and scout are common tasks. The elemental typically wants something in return for its service, usually a gift or bribe appropriate to its nature—incense for air, gems for earth, oil for fire, salts for water, and so on. If the summoners can’t come to an agreement with the elemental, it might make one attack before it leaves. 

Level: The level of the elemental 

Time: Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, music, using ceremonial objects, holding gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle 

Side Effects: Damage, weakness toward one kind of attack 

Reagents: Gifts (black powder, gems, ice, incense, oil, salt, soil, water, wood), destroying opposing items or creatures 

Pool: Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the kind of elemental 

Other Assets: Elemental power, knowledge or control of similar entities, nature magic, secret name of the elemental

Elementals are simple creatures whose interests and attentions are focused on themselves and their element. Flattery and playing up their strengths are the key to bargaining with them.

CONSECRATION 

Wards a location against evil influences and unwanted magic for a year and a day. The ritual affects an area up to a very long distance across. Evil creatures and magical effects of less than the ritual’s level can’t enter the area or use abilities against it. If the PCs are warded out of the designated area, they must make an Intellect defense roll to enter it (and another each minute while within the area, or retreat) and all their actions inside or targeted within the area are hindered by two steps. 

Level: The level of the effects to protect against 

Time: One hour of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Drawing lines and symbols along the border, chanting, calling out local features (with candles, runestones, or other suitable markers) 

Side Effects: Lights, sounds, weak spots or “back doors” in the barrier 

Reagents: Silver dust, sacred oil, buried blessed gemstones 

Pool: Intellect 

Other Assets: Warding magic, religious knowledge 

ENCHANT WEAPON 

Enchants a light, medium, or heavy weapon with magical power, granting an asset on attack rolls with the weapon for the next day. 

Level: 3 or 4 

Time: Thirty minutes of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: — 

Side Effects: Weapon attack hindered, higher GM intrusion rate

Reagents: Rare oils, gem dust 

Pool: Speed or Intellect 

Other Assets: Battle tactics, weapon crafting

In a high-magic campaign, a higher-level version of the Enchant Weapon ritual might grant a second asset on attack rolls, grant extra damage, affect multiple weapons at once, or all of the above.

ENTOMBMENT 

Imprisons a creature in a vessel (usually a valuable box, clay pot, or other closeable container, but it might be a gem, the heart of a tree, or another atypical object) for as long as the vessel remains closed and undamaged. The ritual forces the creature into the vessel, either in a spiritual form or by shrinking it to a size that will fit within the vessel. 

Level: The level of the creature 

Time: Sixteen hours of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, carrying or protecting the vessel 

Side Effects: Bystander imprisoned with the target, containment has a flaw, target lashes out 

Reagents: Vessel, symbolic bindings (chains, ropes, shackles, and so on), anathema objects 

Pool: Intellect 

Other Assets: Control magic, grappling, imprisoning magic, wards

EXORCISM 

Drives out unwanted spirits (ghosts, demons, or something else) from an area up to a long distance across. Once cast out, the spirits cannot return for a year and a day (although most of them decide to move on long before that time comes). Completing the ritual doesn’t prevent other spirits from entering or inhabiting the area, but it is likely that they can sense that an exorcism happened there, and most choose to avoid such an area so they don’t suffer the same fate. The ritual can also be used to cast out spirits from a possessed creature, preventing those spirits from returning for a year and a day. As with using the ritual to cleanse a location, this doesn’t prevent other spirits from afflicting the creature, but later spirits can sense the recent exorcism and prefer to avoid that creature.

Level: The level of the most powerful hostile presence to be exorcised 

Time: Two hours of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Chanting, positive emotions, presenting holy objects, restraining afflicted individuals, tracing the area with incense 

Side Effects: Lights, sounds, hideous physical transformations, injuries, telekinesis 

Reagents: Bindings, candles, holy water, religious icons and books, scapegoats 

Pool: Intellect 

Other Assets: Warding magic, religious knowledge 

Using an exorcism ritual on an area is mainly for getting rid of spirits afflicting the area in ways other than possessing a creature— throwing objects, causing nightmares, making noises, and so on.

FLESH FOR KNOWLEDGE 

Sacrifices some of the ritualist’s flesh, inflicting Might and Speed damage equal to the level of the ritual and permanently reducing the character’s Pools by 4 points (the character can divide this loss between Might and Speed as they see fit). The character experiences painful hallucinations that give them insight and understanding. They immediately learn one type or focus ability available to them (any ability they could learn by spending 4 XP as an advancement). 

Level: Twice the tier of the ability the character wishes to learn 

Time: One hour of preparation, one hour of performance 

Roles: Chanting, restraining the subject of the ritual 

Side Effects: Lasting damage, permanent damage, scarring 

Reagents: Silver knife, silver vessel 

Pool: See above 

Other Assets: Pain tolerance, surgery 

Instead of permanently reducing a character’s Pools by 4 points, the GM could allow other permanent penalties such as reducing an Edge stat by 1 (to a minimum of 0), gaining an inability in a useful skill, or permanently reducing all points gained through recovery rolls by 2.

PURIFICATION 

Rids a creature of an ongoing affliction, such as a disease or poison, or any unwanted magical effect, such as a curse or charm spell. In some versions of this ritual, whatever is ailing the creature gets forced into a nearby specified creature or object, which is then discarded or safely destroyed.

Level: The level of the affliction or effect to remove 

Time: One hour of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Applying reagents, chanting 

Side Effects: Affliction or effect spreads to another creature, target moves a step down the damage track 

Reagents: Anointing oils, healing herbs, objects repellent to the source of the affliction, magical paint for writing on the target, scapegoat, silver dust 

Pool: Might 

Other Assets: Healing magic, resistance to the target’s affliction

RESURRECTION 

Restores a dead being to life. The creature is restored to full health and is ready to act as soon as the ritual is completed. Depending on how they died and the nature of death in the setting, the creature may or may not remember anything that happened after they died. 

Level: The level of the deceased (at least tier 6 if a PC) 

Time: Five hours of preparation, two hours of performance 

Roles: Applying reagents, chanting, prayers, shielding the corpse from hostile entities 

Side Effects: Creature moves a step down the damage track, enmity of a death god, lasting damage, scarring, sympathetic damage 

Reagents: Deceased’s corpse, healing ointment, items of emotional significance (such as devotion, hope, or regret), items of importance to the deceased, parchment extolling the deceased’s history and deeds, soul-sympathetic items 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Close relationship with the deceased (such as a connection or family relation), healing magic, necromancy, spirit knowledge, secret name of the deceased

A lesser version of the Resurrection ritual might bring the creature back to life, but only to the debilitated or impaired state on the damage track instead of hale, requiring further rest or healing. 

SACRIFICIAL RITE 

A creature is ritually killed and its soul is placed in an object. The soul object might be a temporary destination so the soul can be transported and used elsewhere (such as an offering to a demon or as part of a spell), or it might be the final destination for the soul (such as placing it in a sword to create a magic item). 

Level: The level of the creature (at least tier 6 if a PC) 

Time: One hour of preparation, one hour of performance Roles: Chanting, playing instruments, bearing the soul object, restraining the creature, slaying the creature 

Side Effects: Creature rages or escapes, damage, dying curse, haunting 

Reagents: Bindings, creature to be sacrificed, drum, flute, silver knife, soul object (its level must be at least as high as the creature’s level) 

Pool: Might or Intellect 

Other Assets: Death spells, instant-kill abilities, soul manipulation

## MAGICAL TECHNOLOGY

To craft items of magical technology in a setting where they are commonplace, use the standard rules for crafting regular (nonmagical) items.

## MAGIC PLUS TECHNOLOGY

Whatever technology exists in the setting could be magically enhanced if magic is also present. Such items would almost certainly be manifest cyphers or artifacts. Here’s an example cypher:

## FROZEN TIMEPIECE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Creates or transforms into a pocketwatch that seems to be made of ice. Upon activation of the cypher, the user can take normal actions, but everything and everyone around them is frozen in time. The user cannot affect anything else, but they can move through the world and take actions that affect themselves or their own belongings (bandage a wound, repair a broken item, and so on). The effect lasts for one round per cypher level.

And here’s an example artifact:

## TRUTH BINOCULARS

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Pair of binoculars with a large runic symbol on them

Effect: Not only do these make it easy to see things far away, but looking through them also allows the viewer to see through illusions and see things that are normally invisible, assuming the effect has a level lower than that of the binoculars.

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100 (check each use)

To craft items that are both technological and magical, either you need to make the device first and then enchant it, or you need to enchant it as it is made. Either way, the skills for making the device and for making it magical are likely very different.

## TECHNOLOGY THAT INTERACTS WITH MAGIC

In a world with scientists and engineers faced with the presence of real magic, some of them would develop ways to interact and cope with it. Technological devices that are not magical but deal with magic could include:

Magic detector (expensive): This simple white badge glows purple in the presence of magic. Once it detects something magical, it does not function again. 

Mystical hazard suit (very expensive): This full-body protective suit is cumbersome and clumsy, not unlike a hazmat suit. However, all of the wearer’s tasks to resist magical effects are eased. If the wearer takes even 1 point of physical damage, the suit rips and no longer functions until it is repaired and resealed. 

Spellscrambler (very expensive): Essentially a sonic grenade, this device produces a variety of strange electromagnetic signals—some audible and very loud, some not—on a number of frequencies. The mental processes needed to cast a spell are impossible to achieve for one round within a short distance of the device. Like any grenade, it can be used only once.

## MAGIC THAT INTERACTS WITH TECHNOLOGY

In a world where magic and technology coexist, wizards will have spells and effects that protect them from shotgun blasts as well as sword blades, and radiation as well as fire or frost. Consider, for example, these effects as cyphers:

FINDING PRYING EYES 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: Magically discovers if anything is watching or listening to the user right at that moment, and reveals the source. Electronic surveillance devices, long-range scopes, hidden cameras, and magical scrying attempts all trigger this effect. In all these cases, the “source” is the nearest representation. So a hidden microphone is revealed, but not the location of the listener. 

POWER DEVICE 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: Magically powers one device that can fit within an area a short distance across. The device is now fully powered, charged, or fueled. If the cypher is used on an automobile, for example, the gas tank is full. If used on a flashlight, the battery is fully charged. 

SCREEN CONTROL 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: A technological screen (a television, computer monitor, smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.

Because magic works on intuitive rather than scientific levels, mages could have spells that disrupt technology, even though the technology involved might not have any common principles

## MIND CONTROL

From a rules perspective, mind control is fairly straightforward: one creature decides what actions another creature takes (perhaps limited in that the controlled creature won’t take actions that harm them or go against their nature, such as attacking friends). But what’s happening inside the controlled creature’s head—whether during the effect or afterward—often isn’t specified. There are several options for the GM to consider, either for all kinds of mind-control magic or on a case-by-case basis. 

- Confusion: The controlled creature doesn’t understand why they’re doing things they normally wouldn’t do, but they aren’t aware of any outside influence on their thoughts and actions. Once the control is over, the creature may admit that they don’t know why they did those things, or come up with an explanation justifying (to themselves and others) their reasons for those actions. 

- Dream: The controlled creature is aware of what’s going on but perceives it in a dreamlike state. They may believe that they’re in control of themselves the entire time, or somewhat aware that they’re not fully in control (similar to being intoxicated by drugs or alcohol or disoriented by an illness). Afterward, the creature might feel strange about the events but may not realize that someone else was controlling them. 

- Trapped: The active thoughts in the controlled creature’s head come from the controller, but the creature still has a small voice or awareness in the background, like they’re a prisoner in their own mind. This horrible situation usually means the controlled creature reverts to normal once the control is gone, and is probably very upset that their mind and body autonomy were violated.

One way to present mind control more safely is to disallow certain actions but otherwise leave the character in control. For example, being charmed by a vampire might mean the PC can’t attack the vampire (or its allies) or run away, but is still able to call for help, heal themselves, leave at a normal pace, and take other actions. Alternatively, the character can be given a specific command, and until they comply with that command their other actions are hindered by one or more steps. If the player is willing to engage with the parameters of the mind control, the GM may award them an additional 1 XP (or, to approach it from the opposite direction, the GM can offer them a GM intrusion that the mind control is happening, and allow the player to spend 1 XP to refuse it, or go into XP debt if they want to refuse it but have no XP to spend).

A rule for any game: don’t use mind control (or anything) to make a character have sex without the player’s permission. For more information and guidelines about consent in RPGs, read the free Consent in Gaming PDF at myMCG.info/consent

## MYSTICAL MARTIAL ARTS

If the setting calls for wuxia-style fantasy martial arts or similar types of action, you can make a few rule changes to portray the kinds of things characters in such stories can accomplish.

- Running and climbing speeds and jumping distances are doubled. For those trained in running, climbing, or jumping, the speeds and distances are tripled instead of doubled. For those specialized, they are quintupled. For all intents and purposes, this means that everyone can run up a wall or jump very high in the air, and masters can practically fly or run across water.

- Everyone knows kung fu. Unless a person is a simple farmer, herder, or merchant, they know how to fight with elaborate and powerful martial arts styles. This doesn’t change anything in the game mechanically—no one gets the ability to use weapons that they wouldn’t normally have under the rules. But it does change the flavor, suggesting that no PC is entirely ignorant of weapons or close combat. 

- Players are encouraged to come up with interesting names for their martial arts abilities. Instead of using a Bash attack, perhaps it is “The Three-Flower Fist,” and instead of Fury, a character uses “The Rage of the Sevenfold.” It is reasonable for high-tier martial abilities such as Amazing Effort, Jump Attack, or Finishing Blow to be described with a magical flare— blazing auras of fire, brilliant cascades of light, ethereal figures overlaying the character, and so on. 

- Materials and objects are easier to destroy. For the purpose of attacking objects, subtract 2 from the level of any material (minimum of 0). It should be relatively simple for any character to smash through a plain wooden door with little effort, and true warriors can shatter stones with their blows. 

- Wounds heal faster. Everyone gains +1 to all recovery rolls. 

- Superhuman abilities exist. Consider adopting some of the superhero rules from the Cypher System Reference Document, in particular the power shift optional rules. These may derive from almost supernatural levels of training in various techniques (such as dianxue) but probably mostly from neili.

> Dianxue: The touch of death—killing by using precise nonlethal force on key points of the body. Neili: Internal force— building up and cultivating the energy known as qi and using it for supernatural effects.

## POSSESSION

Some creatures (demons, ghosts, entities of living mental energy, and so on) have the ability to possess a living person, taking over a character’s body as if it were the creature’s own. The creature must touch the character to attempt possession (even if the creature’s touch normally inflicts damage, the possession attempt doesn’t inflict damage). The character must make an Intellect defense roll or become possessed, whereupon the creature’s immaterial form disappears into the character.

The first round in which a character is possessed, they can act normally. In the second and all subsequent rounds, the possessing creature can try to control the actions of the host, but the character can attempt an Intellect defense roll to resist each suggested action. Successful resistance means that the character does nothing for one round. When the creature isn’t trying to control the host, the character can act as they choose. Usually, a possessing creature’s actions are limited to controlling its host and leaving the host (the creature’s own abilities are unavailable to it while in someone else’s body).

While it possesses a character, the creature is immune to most direct attacks (though not so the host; killing the host will eject the creature). For example, hitting a demon-possessed human with a sword hurts only the human, not the demon controlling them. Mental attacks and special abilities that only affect possession or the type of possessing creature usually work normally

A possessed character is allowed an Intellect defense roll to eject the creature once per day. The defense roll is hindered by one additional step each day of possession after the first seven days. An ejected, cast-out, or exorcised demon is powerless for one or more days. One way to exorcise a demon is to command it out in the name of an entity that has power over the demon. This can be attempted once per day and grants the possessed character an additional Intellect defense roll to eject the demon.

Possession is like mind control in that it takes away a player’s ability to control their character, and that can make some players very uncomfortable. See the section on mind control and consent for more information (page 67).

## SECRET AND TRUE NAMES

Learning a creature’s true name comes with a subtle and instinctive awareness and understanding of that creature, including its strengths and weaknesses. In general, this eases all tasks related to that creature (including attacks, defenses, and interactions) by two steps. In some cases, confronting a creature with knowledge of its true name might be enough to convince it to perform a service without compensation. A creature doesn’t automatically know if someone has learned its true name (although there is magic that can reveal this knowledge), but they can usually figure out that an informed opponent has some kind of advantage against them and deduce that their secret name is involved. 

Learning a true name is difficult and takes time. A character wanting to discover a creature’s true name might choose the Uncover a Secret character arc to do so.

## WISHES

Unless the GM’s intention is to make the players regret that their characters were offered a wish, it’s best to give them what they ask for, as much as it is within the power of the creature to do so. If the GM wants to twist the wish, do so as a GM intrusion— that way, the character still gets a reward, and they can either accept the twisted wish (which isn’t as good as they had hoped) or pay 1 XP to reject the intrusion (which represents them coming up with airtight wording that can’t be twisted).

Second, consider the level of the creature granting the wish—that’s basically the level of the wish, as the creature shouldn’t be able to grant a boon more powerful than itself. Therefore, it’s reasonable that a level 6 creature could create a level 6 effect. The GM could look at the creature’s other abilities (or abilities of other creatures of its level), decide if what the PC is asking for is within its power, and either grant the requested wish or adjust the result downward until it’s appropriate for the creature’s power. 

Wishing for more wishes doesn’t work because a creature shouldn’t be able to create something more powerful than itself—at least not without some investment of time and other resources, like a character using XP to acquire an artifact.

FANTASY RULES MODULES 

## AWARDING TREASURE

It’s best to think of gold and magic as two different kinds of currencies that characters have access to. 

## GOLD

The Cypher System abstracts item costs into general categories— inexpensive, moderate, expensive, and so on. Starting characters generally have access to only a few inexpensive and moderate items and perhaps one or two expensive items. In a typical fantasy campaign, the characters should become wealthier as they advance. 

## MANIFEST CYPHERS

The expectation is that PCs will use cyphers often because they’ll have many opportunities to get more; if the players can exploit this mechanic by selling off most of their cyphers in town, they’re abusing the rules to make gold. The GM might be tempted to discourage this behavior by reducing how often the PCs gain new cyphers, but that goes against the premise of cyphers in the game: they should be common enough that the PCs use them freely instead of hoarding them. The key to addressing this selling-cyphers wealth problem is to make it harder to sell or trade cyphers for gold.

The PCs can have opportunities to trade their cyphers with NPCs in town, whether that’s at a magic item shop, the tower of a mentor wizard, a thieves’ guild, a temple, other adventurers, or the local government. The kinds of cyphers these NPCs can offer may be limited in theme (such as a benevolent church that makes healing potions and trades them for other useful cyphers) or quantity (such as having only one or two cyphers available each month). Two cyphers of the same level are generally considered to be about the same value, although local biases and NPC interests may affect their willingness to trade certain items despite or because of a level disparity

## ARTIFACTS

Artifacts are the high end of magical currency, and in terms of buying and selling them, they’re like manifest cyphers: not something a typical NPC can use, and beyond what a typical NPC can afford, but they could be traded for a different artifact of about the same level. Unlike cyphers, the game doesn’t assume that PCs have frequent opportunities to gain new artifacts or replace the ones that deplete. 

In a pinch, an artifact is worth the equivalent of one or two very expensive items or one exorbitant item, depending on what the artifact can do. An artifact that grants an asset to one kind of roll is probably worth about as much as a very expensive item, one that adds +1 Armor might be worth two expensive items, and a strong defensive or offensive artifact could be worth about the same as an exorbitant item.

## DUNGEONS, CASTLES, AND KEEPS

This section describes several kinds of common physical features and their game stats. Any of these levels can be adjusted up or down by the GM—a wall made from soft wood can have a lower level than a typical wall, stone can be reinforced by magic so its level is higher, and so on.

## WALLS

Walls are generally either constructed (intentionally built by a creature) or natural (already existing without any work by a creature). Anything describing walls in this section also applies to ceilings and floors. 

- Paper wall (level 1): This thin wall only blocks sight. Creatures can attack through a paper wall as if attacking blindly (hindered by four steps), but it’s usually easier to break a hole in the wall and attack through the hole. Paper walls are vulnerable to piercing and slashing weapons (attacks are eased). A gauzy curtain is equivalent to a paper wall, and a cloth wall is probably level 2. 

- Wooden wall (level 4): This is a typical wall for an average wooden house. The walls of a decrepit shack or a partition within a dungeon might be only level 2 or 3, but the exterior palisade wall of a fort or a log cabin might be level 5. Wooden walls are vulnerable to fire (attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing weapons (attacks are hindered). 

- Stone wall (level 6): Constructed stone walls are bricks or masonry (fitted stones), with or without mortar to hold them in place, or hewn stone (dug into existing natural rock). Natural stone walls are usually unworked stone (like a cave wall or cliff face, which tend to be uneven) but might have areas where creatures smoothed or modified them to suit their needs for a living space. Some constructed stone walls are reinforced with metal bars on the surface or built inside, increasing its level to 7. Stone walls are vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are hindered). 

- Iron wall (level 7): These expensive walls are usually reserved for protecting something important, like a vault.

## DOORS

Doors are access points for encounters and (if trapped or infested with dangerous creatures) can be encounters all on their own. In most cases, trying to break through a door involves damaging its latch or hinges rather than destroying the main portion of the door (trying to destroy the door instead of the latch and hinges is a hindered task). 

- Simple wooden door (level 2): This is a fragile door meant to close off an interior space for privacy rather than to keep out a determined intruder. Instead of a single piece of wood, a simple wooden door is usually made of multiple planks nailed together on a frame or with support struts. Wooden doors of all strengths are vulnerable to fire (attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing weapons (attacks are hindered). 

- Good wooden door (level 3): This is a stronger door meant to provide some security, such as for a typical house or shop. 

- Strong wooden door (level 4): This is a heavy door reinforced with wood or metal to make it difficult to break. An especially strong wooden door, such as the main entrance to a fort or castle, is probably level 5. 

- Stone door (level 5): These heavy doors are usually carved from a solid block of stone and designed to pivot on a center point. They are common in places like dungeons where wood and metal are scarce. Stone doors are vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are hindered). 

- Iron door (level 6): A solid iron door is meant to protect something very valuable or vulnerable, such as a vault or a king’s tomb. In a damp environment like a dungeon, they tend to rust and stick in place. 

- Wooden portcullis (level 3): The gaps in a portcullis present more defense opportunities than a door, such as allowing archers to fire at the creatures trapped by it. They’re also useful in closing access to a waterway without impacting its flow. A wooden portcullis is relatively fragile and usually isn’t meant to keep anyone out for long. 

- Iron portcullis (level 6): Much sturdier than wood, an iron portcullis is meant to keep creatures in place as long as necessary. Often the best way to get past a portcullis is to lift it instead of breaking it, but some are designed to lock in place to prevent this. A door to a prison cell is essentially a type of iron portcullis.

## TRAPS

One common element of fantasy exploration—particularly for castles and dungeons—is the danger of traps.

## TRIGGERING TRAPS

Mechanical traps have a triggering mechanism—something set up to react when an unauthorized creature is in the area. Magical traps have triggers that are usually based on proximity—if a creature enters the area the trap is “watching,” it activates.

## FINDING TRAPS

Most characters won’t notice traps unless actively looking for them; they don’t know a trap is in the area until their presence, movement, or action triggers it. Characters can passively or actively search for traps if they suspect such dangers are present. 

Passive searching for traps means one character (usually in the front of the group) is carefully checking the area before moving forward. This means the group moves at about half normal speed, but they get to make a search roll for any traps the GM has in their path. Allowing characters to passively search in this way means the players don’t have to keep stating over and over that they’re looking for traps. The drawback for them is that it takes them more time to get anywhere (which means time-based special abilities and cyphers will run out sooner).

Active searching is used when the characters worry or suspect that there is a trap in the area and want to find it. Active searching takes about one round for each immediate area searched. Rather than having the players make separate rolls for each immediate area, the GM should have them make one roll for the entire room; if successful, they find the trap, and if they fail, they don’t find it. If there is a second trap, the GM can have them make another roll after they’ve resolved the first trap.

## DISABLING, DAMAGING, AND BYPASSING TRAPS

A character can attempt to disable a trap so it’s no longer able to activate or harm anyone. Normally this task has the same difficulty as the trap’s level, but some traps are rickety and easy to disable, while others are carefully crafted and much harder to disable. Traps are objects and use the object damage track. Characters can attack a trap with weapons or special abilities to damage or destroy it. Some traps may be vulnerable to certain attacks or unusual means of sabotage (such as hammering a piton into a groove where a blade springs out). Magical traps can be damaged or disabled with special abilities.

Instead of disabling a trap, a character can try to bypass it so they and their allies can get past it without triggering it but still leave it as a danger to anyone else who passes through the area. The task to bypass a trap is hindered by two steps

Failing an attempt to disable, bypass, or sabotage a trap means it activates. Usually the trap’s target is the acting character, and the trap’s attack is eased because the character placed themselves in harm’s way

Unless a character has the ability to manipulate magic, it’s very difficult to bypass a magical trap (the attempt is hindered by two additional steps).

## UNDERSTANDING THE LISTINGS

The rest of the chapter presents a large number of traps with game stats. Every trap is presented by name, followed by a standard template that includes the following categories. If an entry doesn’t apply to a particular trap, it is omitted from the listing. 

Level: Like the difficulty of a task, each trap has a level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to find, evade, or disable the trap. In each entry, the difficulty number for the trap is listed after its level (always three times the trap’s level). 

Description: This general description explains what the trap does, how it operates, whether it resets automatically, if it has a limited number of uses, and so on.

Damage Inflicted: Generally, when a trap hits a creature, it inflicts its level in damage regardless of the form of attack (arrow, poison, collapsing ceiling, and so on). The entries always specify the amount of damage inflicted, even if it’s the normal amount for a trap of its level. 

Modifications: Use these numbers when a trap’s information says to use a different target number. For example, a level 4 trap might say “defends as level 5,” which means PCs attacking it or trying to disable it must roll a target number of 15 (for difficulty 5) instead of 12 (for difficulty 4). Typical modifiers are to the trap’s attacks, defenses, and stealth (how hard or easy it is to notice the trap). 

GM Intrusion: This entry suggests one or more ways to use GM intrusions in an encounter with the trap. It’s just one possible idea of many, and the GM is encouraged to come up with their own uses of the game mechanic.

## COMMON TRAP POISONS

- Blindness: The poison blinds the creature if they fail a defense roll. Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour. 

- Choking: The poison makes the creature choke and cough if they fail a defense roll. Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour. Severe versions of choking poison might make a creature start to suffocate. 

- Damage Track: The poison moves the creature down one step on the damage track if they fail a defense roll. 

- Debilitating: The poison hinders all of the creature’s actions by one or two steps if they fail a defense roll. (Some poisons may affect only certain kinds of actions, such as Speed defense rolls or Might-based tasks.) Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. 

- Instant Damage: The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect) one time if the creature fails a defense roll. 

- Ongoing Damage: The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect) immediately. When a certain amount of time has passed (such as every round or every minute), it inflicts damage again if the creature fails its defense roll. The ongoing damage usually ends on its own (such as after five additional rounds of damage) or after the creature makes a defense roll against it. Usually the ongoing damage is a much smaller amount than the initial damage, such as 1 point every round. 

- Paralysis: The poison prevents the creature from taking any physical actions if they fail a defense roll (this might leave them standing in place like a statue, or make them go limp and collapse to the floor). Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. 

- Sleep: The poison knocks the creature unconscious if they fail a defense roll. Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. The poison might also make the creature groggy, hindering all actions for an additional amount of time equal to how long the unconsciousness would have lasted (for example, knocking out a creature for an hour and then making them groggy for an hour, even if they’re awakened early).

ARROW 4 (12)

Fires an arrow or crossbow bolt. The simplest one-use trap of this kind is an actual crossbow (perhaps hidden behind a hole in a wall or door) rigged with a tripwire to pull the trigger; a creature would need to manually reset this trap for it to be a danger again. More complex traps might automatically reload from a supply of bolts so the trap can be triggered multiple times, or fire automatically once triggered until the ammunition is expended. A variant of this trap releases a volley of arrows into the targeted area, affecting multiple creatures or the same creature more than once. 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Modifications: Defense and stealth as level 6 (if hidden behind a hole in the wall) 

GM Intrusion: The arrow is barbed, and removing it inflicts 3 points of damage. The arrow is attached to a string, cord, or wire, with the other end tied to something dangerous like a falling block or an electrical shock.

CRUSHING WALL 6 (18)

A section of a wall falls over onto the targeted character. This is usually a one-use trap (although a similar trap could be built in its place). 

A variant of this trap is a deadfall, where something heavy (such as a log, huge stone block, or cart full of rocks) falls from a higher position onto the character. Sometimes the falling block is made to exactly fit a trapped corridor so that triggering the trap makes the area impassible.

 A less lethal variant drops a large amount of sand or dirt, inflicting 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). Another variant releases oil (perhaps burning) or marbles, inflicting 3 points of ambient damage and making the area difficult terrain.

Damage Inflicted: 6 points (ignores Armor) 

GM Intrusion: The fallen wall blocks access to an exit. The wall debris buries the character, who is trapped until they can dig free. Another trap, hazard, or threat is behind the fallen wall (such as arrow traps or a room full of zombies) and can now reach the characters.

DISINTEGRATION 7 (21)

A magical ray of eerie energy blasts the character, disrupting their physical matter. Any creature killed by the ray (or any object destroyed by it) turns to dust. 

Damage Inflicted: 15 points 

GM Intrusion: In addition to inflicting damage, the ray moves the character one step down the damage track. Part of the ray splits or ricochets off the character and strikes a second creature, inflicting 10 points of damage. 

EXPLOSIVE GLYPH 4 (12)

A magical rune activates when touched or passed over, exploding in an immediate or short area. Typical glyphs inflict acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, but more unusual versions include ones that inflict holy, shadow, thorn, unholy, or stranger types of magical energy damage. A nonmagical variant of this trap sprays a mist of acid, a jet of electrified salt water, or a gout of burning oil. 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points of energy damage (ignores Armor); all creatures in the area take 1 point of damage even if they make their defense roll. 

Modifications: Stealth as level 5 

GM Intrusion: The glyph marks the character’s face with a symbol indicating they are a thief. The glyph makes the character run away in fear for one minute. The character is cursed, and all of their actions are hindered until the curse is removed.

FLOODING ROOM 4 (12)

Exits to the room close off and the area starts to fill with water. Within a few minutes, the entire room is flooded and creatures in it begin to drown. 

A variant of this room reduces the air pressure (either by pumping it out through tiny holes or by retracting the floor or ceiling). As the air gets thinner, characters are hindered by one, two, or three steps before falling unconscious and starting to suffocate. (Restoring the air allows the characters to awaken, but doesn’t move them back up the damage track.) 

Damage Inflicted: None until drowning starts 

Modifications: Defends as level 7 

GM Intrusion: Hostile creatures such as piranhas or electric eels are in the water and attack all creatures. The room fills with water faster than expected because the floor and/or ceiling are also moving toward each other.

MANGLER 3 (9)

A small hole in the wall extends sharp blades or weights when a creature reaches into it, mangling their hand and hindering all actions requiring that hand by one or two steps. 

A floor variant is a small trapdoor over a closed compartment, which mangles the character’s foot when they step on the trapdoor, reducing their movement speed by half.

 Another variant is a needle trap attached to a small peephole or spyhole in a door or wall. The trap springs when the character touches the area around the hole (even a slight touch with their face as they look is sufficient), inflicting lasting damage to the character’s eye and partially blinding them. A gentler variant traps the character’s limb in glue instead of inflicting damage. The character’s extremity might be glued to the hole, or they may be able to pull free but have a glue pot stuck on their hand or foot. 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points, plus lasting damage 

Modifications: Stealth as level 4 

GM Intrusion: The trap has hooks, holding the character in place and inflicting damage when they try to escape if they fail a Speed defense roll. The glue attracts a swarm of fire ants or wasps. The glue is also a slow-acting acid or poison.

NET 3 (9)

A net suspended above the character drops and constricts (and perhaps lifts the character off the ground). Large net traps can affect multiple creatures at once. This kind of trap usually requires a creature to manually reset it.

A variant of this trap is a snare made of sturdy cord or wire. 

Damage Inflicted: Entanglement (trapped character cannot move until they use an action to make a Might or Speed defense roll to break or escape the net) 

Modifications: Attacks as level 5, defends as level 2 

GM Intrusion: The net is barbed, inflicting 1 point of damage each round that the trapped character tries to move. The net is the nesting place for biting insects, which swarm and attack the trapped character and all nearby creatures each round.

PIT 4 (12)

A trapdoor in the floor opens, dropping the triggering character into a pit. Larger versions of this trap can catch multiple characters at once. The trap can be reset by moving the trapdoor back into its closed position. In outdoor areas, this trap is more likely to be a pit covered in leafy branches (or a tarp) and camouflaged by soil and other debris. 

A variant of this trap is a bridge over a chasm, river, or other dangerous location that is rigged to collapse when enough weight reaches the middle section. 

Damage Inflicted: 1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet fallen (ignores Armor) 

GM Intrusion: The trapdoor is slippery with oil, hindering attempts to catch the edge and avoid falling. The trapdoor closes after the character falls through, trapping them inside in the darkness. The walls of the pit are greased, hindering attempts to climb out by two steps. A dangerous creature is at the bottom of the pit (or in a room adjacent to it). The pit is filled with poison gas. The trapdoor detaches and falls into the pit, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet it falls. The pit has spikes at the bottom, inflicting an additional 4 points of damage to anyone who falls in.

POISON GAS 3 (9)

The area slowly fills with poison gas. Because it takes a minute or more for the poison to become thick enough to cause harm, it is likely that the character won’t realize at first that they’ve sprung a trap. 

A variant of this trap fills the room with flammable gas, which explodes if there is an open flame (such as from a torch) or a spark (such as a metal weapon against metal armor), inflicting fire damage equal to the trap’s level. 

A further variant fills the room with dead air (containing no oxygen), which slowly extinguishes flames and suffocates creatures. 

Damage Inflicted: As poison 

Modifications: Stealth as level 5 

GM Intrusion: The character has an allergic reaction to the gas, which hinders all their actions for an hour after exposure because of sneezing, watery eyes, or itchy skin. The gas makes the character hallucinate, mistaking their companions for enemies, until they make an Intellect defense roll. The gas is flammable.

POISON NEEDLE 5 (15)

A poisoned needle jabs at a character touching the trapped object (usually a lock or treasure chest) or is fired from a mechanism similar to an arrow trap. It may have a reservoir of poison that allows it to attack several times. 

Damage Inflicted: 1 point (plus poison)

Modifications: Stealth as level 6 

GM Intrusion: The trap releases acid into the lock mechanism, making the trapped object impossible to unlock. The trap releases acid into the container, destroying some of the valuables inside. The trap releases a puff of poison gas instead of a poisoned needle, affecting all nearby characters.

PORTCULLIS 5 (15)

An iron portcullis drops from the ceiling to block access to an area or separate a character from others nearby. If the creature dodging the falling portcullis wants to choose which side of the trap they end up on, the Speed defense roll is hindered. Otherwise, it is even chances what side they end up on. 

A variant of this trap is a solid wall. A magical variant is a force field. 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

GM Intrusion: The portcullis impales the character, trapping them beneath it until it is lifted or destroyed. The portcullis is electrified, inflicting 1 point of damage each time it is touched or attacked with flesh or a metal object. A second portcullis drops nearby, trapping a character in a small area. Murder-holes in the ceiling allow enemies to make ranged attacks on the trapped character.

ROLLING BOULDER 6 (12)

A large boulder, wheel, or barrel rolls into the area, crushing anything in its path. Depending on the configuration of the area, the boulder might follow a specific path, ricochet erratically, break open pit traps, or get stuck somewhere. 

A variant is a large iron weight on a chain that swings from the ceiling. The weight swings back and forth several times, giving it multiple chances to hit the characters, but decreasing its damage with each swing until it stops and becomes an obstacle. 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Modifications: Defends as level 7 

GM Intrusion: The boulder crashes through a door or wall, giving other dangerous creatures access to the character’s location. The boulder blocks the way out. The boulder carries a character along with it for some distance. The boulder is hollow and full of burning oil, leaving a fiery trail behind it. The boulder is hollow and contains undead skeletons, which jump out as it moves and attack nearby creatures.

SLICING BLADE 5 (15)

A thin blade slices out from a gap in the wall, floor, or ceiling. The trap might be designed to sweep the entire area (such as the width of a corridor) or leave a tiny safe space just beyond the blade’s reach so a creature who knows of the trap can get past it. This kind of trap is usually designed to reset automatically after a minute or has a lever nearby that allows a creature to reset it manually. 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Modifications: Attacks as level 6 

GM Intrusion: The blade is a magical weapon with an additional effect, such as inflicting 3 points of fire damage. The blade is rusted and breaks off when it hits the character, inflicting 1 point of damage (ignores Armor) each round after the initial attack until it is healed.

SLIDING STAIR 4 (12)

A stairway or section of stairs unexpectedly turns into a ramp. Anyone who makes a Speed defense roll can catch hold near where they were standing; otherwise, they slide or tumble to the bottom and take damage. This kind of trap usually resets after a minute or has a manual reset lever at the top or bottom of the stairs. 

Damage Inflicted: 1 point of ambient damage per 20 feet slid (ignores Armor) 

GM Intrusion: The trap releases oil, hindering attempts to climb the ramp or stairs by two steps. Tiny blades stick out between the sections of the ramp, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage. The trap releases a boulder to roll down the stairs after the sliding character, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage.

SNAKE PIT 4 (12)

The trap drops the character into a pit full of snakes or drops a large number of snakes on the character. The snakes immediately attack the character and perhaps others in the area. 

Damage Inflicted: As per the swarm of snakes 

GM Intrusion: The snake poison is especially potent, moving the character one step down the damage track if they fail a Might defense roll. The snakes constrict the character, hindering their actions until the snakes are defeated.

SPEAR 4 (12)

The trap fires a spear, javelin, or other large projectile. (In many ways, this is a scaled-up and more dangerous version of an arrow trap, and the same suggestions for that trap apply to this one.) 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Modifications: Defense and stealth as level 5 (if hidden behind a hole in a wall) 

GM Intrusion: The impact of the spear knocks the character prone. The spear is barbed, and removing it inflicts 3 points of damage. The spear is attached to a string, cord, or wire, with the other end tied to something dangerous like a falling block or an electrical shock

TELEPORTER 6 (18)

The trap magically moves the character to another location within about 1,000 feet (300 m), typically a prison cell, an oubliette, or a very deep pit. It’s more efficient to kill an intruder than to teleport them, so teleportation is usually reserved for trapping creatures for interrogation. 

Damage Inflicted: None 

GM Intrusion: The teleport destination is above the ground, causing the character to fall some distance and take damage (1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet fallen). The destination is dangerous, such as a tiny room lined with spikes, a shark tank, or a boulder in a lava lake.

## CHARACTER OPTIONS

## MODERN MAGIC CHARACTER OPTIONS

## DESCRIPTORS

Most of these descriptors are for characters who are or become significantly nonhuman

nonhuman; for example, the Dragon descriptor means you’re a four-legged, winged dragon who can breathe flame. These descriptors include suggestions for how to advance or improve your inherent nature as that sort of creature (becoming even more dragonish if you are a Dragon, for example). The GM should allow a character with such a descriptor to choose any of these abilities (and any others the GM feels are appropriate for the descriptor) in place of a type ability, either upon advancing to a new tier or selecting them as an other option of character advancement by spending 4 XP.

It’s Only Magic Descriptors: Chimera, Dragon, Ghost, Hunter, Nix, Sylph, Unmagical

Chimera

You have a blend of animal attributes; you may be a well-known mythological creature,

like a satyr or minotaur, or you may have a unique combination of features. Bison horns,

boar tusks, bear paws, a wolf’s tail, a lion’s mane: take your pick. Your thickened skin offers

protection from attacks and the elements. Depending on your dexterity—and whether you

have opposable thumbs—you may use adaptive weapons and tools, like a dagger modified

to be held in a paw instead of a hand. You’re eager to protect the ones closest to you, and

usually more likely to run toward conflict than away from it.

You gain the following characteristics:

Fur and Hide: +1 to Armor.

Animal Strength: +1 to your Might Pool.

Charging Ahead: You’re trained in initiative.

For the Gang: You stick up for your friends. When you draw the attack, your defense is only hindered by one step.

Ham-fisted: Tasks requiring fine motor skills are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. A herd, a pride, a pack, a flock: whatever the collective noun for chimeras is, you’re looking to build (or join) one.

2\. You need supplies to adapt a legendary weapon perfectly to your physique.

3\. The other PCs were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you protected them from harm.

Chimera Advancement:

Athlete

Dual Light Wield

Enhanced Might

Enhanced Speed

Fists of Fury

Frenzy

Dragon

You can shift at will between a dragon and humanoid form; you may choose to spend more time in one form or the other. In your dragon form you’re about 10 feet (3.5 m) long with four legs, leathery wings, and a serpentlike tail. You’re drawn to treasure and shiny things, but you’re willing to share your hoard with those you trust. Though you can speak human languages, you can’t ignore the fact that you’re a wild part of your local ecosystem—at least some of the time. You’re an apex predator, driven to fly and to hunt, and you brumate in cold temperatures like other reptiles.

Brumation is a state of sluggishness and inactivity entered by reptiles in response to low temperatures.

You gain the following characteristics:

Dragon Form: You have both a humanoid form and a dragon form, and you can switch forms up to four times in a 24-hour period. In dragon form, your Speed defense tasks are hindered due to your size. Enabler.

Tough: +2 to your Might Pool.

Fireproof: +2 Armor against damage inflicted by fire or heat.

Wings (1 Might point): When you have wings, you can fly a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action, for up to ten minutes total. Enabler.

Teeth: You are skilled in making unarmed bite attacks, which are a medium weapon in your dragon form and a light weapon in. your humanoid form. Enabler.

Spitting Flames (1+ Might point): You can breathe a ball of fire at a target within short range, inflicting 3 points of fire damage. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action.

Inability: Cold weather makes you want to burrow somewhere cozy and go dormant. Speed tasks are hindered when the temperature falls below 50°F (10°C).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The other PCs were hired as dragon hunters, but once they met you they realized their mission was misguided.

2\. You’re hoping to find a specific discontinued currency to add to your hoard.

3\. You got stuck in your dragon form while molting, and the other PCs helped remove your shed skin.

4\. You’re gathering ingredients for a difficult spell that will increase the range and intensity of your fire-breathing attacks.

Dragon Advancement:

Danger Sense

Defensive Field

Enhanced Might

Enhanced Might Edge

Enlarge

Training in Spitting Flames

Ghost

Unfortunately, you’re dead. But hey, it’s not all bad! Your spirit has remained in the mortal world. You can still walk among the living, but you no longer need pesky things like food or sleep. It’s up to you how long you’ve been dead, whether you remember your death, and why you’ve stuck around: seeking revenge, settling a debt, protecting your descendants, perfecting your great-grandma’s pecan pie recipe, or something else entirely.

You gain the following characteristics:

Ghostly Wisdom: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Sneaky: You’re trained in stealth and intimidation.

Incorporeal: You’re trained in Speed defense.

Calling the Dead: You’re trained in communicating with other ghosts, wraiths, undead, and so on. You can also serve as a catalyst for communication with the dead, providing an asset to a living character attempting such a task (such as a séance or summoning).

Insubstantial: All physical attacks are hindered.

Dead: Positive social interaction tasks with living creatures are hindered.

Uniform: You’re permanently wearing the clothes you had on when you died. This can hinder social interactions if you’re inappropriately dressed for the setting (wearing a bathrobe and slippers to a formal party, for example).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You’re on a journey to make amends with someone you wronged in life.

2\. You’re looking for the resting place of your physical body so you can be resurrected.

3\. One of the other PCs is a distant relative, and you need to keep them alive so your bloodline continues.

4\. You’re studying the secrets of reincarnation and suspect that one of the other PCs has vital information.

Ghost Advancement:

Duplicate

Question the Spirits

See the Unseen

Speaker for the Dead

Surprise Attack

Walk Through Walls

Hunter

You once rode with the Wild Hunt: an immortal cavalry who traversed the skies in secret each night, gathering the souls of those who died in battle and carrying them to the beyond. These days, the Wild Hunt has downsized and your nights are your own. You’re mortal again, too, but it’s impossible to forget the terrifying freedom and power you once held. Maybe you’ve let nostalgia make you bitter, or maybe you don’t miss the Hunt at all, instead living in fear of being conscripted once more.

You gain the following characteristics:

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Equestrian: You’re trained in handling and riding horses.

Sword Hand: You’re proficient with two-handed swords and can use them without penalty.

Hearing the Dead: You’re skilled in all social interactions with ghosts.

The Call of the Hunt: You’re often distracted by sounds that remind you of the Wild Hunt, such as horns and baying hounds. Tasks requiring concentration are hindered.

Lost Years: In the years you belonged to the Wild Hunt, you lost touch with advancing technology. Tasks involving computers, pop culture, and recent history are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You ferried the soul of a PC’s relative to the afterlife. When you left the Wild Hunt, you found the PC to tell them of their relative’s brave deeds.

2\. The living only see the Wild Hunt cross the sky if they’re destined for disaster. A PC saw the Wild Hunt years ago, and you’ve taken it upon yourself to protect them.

3\. You’re afraid that the leader of the Wild Hunt will summon you, and you need help concealing yourself.

4\. You’re searching for the horse you remember riding—a massive undead stallion with flaming hooves.

Nix

You’re a shapeshifting water spirit. You can walk on two legs and breathe air, but when you’re submerged, you gain a tail, fins, and gills. You probably live near flowing water, with no preference for salinity or temperature; you also have a general affinity for nature and a knack for identifying useful plants. Your playful and upbeat disposition doesn’t mean you’re passive or helpless. Though you may prefer to talk your way out of tough situations, you’re quick to react to threats—especially in water, where you maneuver with deadly accuracy.

You gain the following characteristics:

Transformation: When submerged in water, you transform into a fish/human hybrid with gills, fins, sharp teeth, and a tail. This transformation is automatic. Enabler.

Unchillable: +2 Armor against damage caused by cold or ice.

Sharp Teeth: You are skilled in making an unarmed bite attack, which is a medium weapon in your aquatic form and a light weapon in your humanoid form. Enabler.

Quick Swimming: You can swim a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action.

Close to Nature: You’re skilled in identifying plants and animals.

Siren Song: You’re extremely charismatic. You’re skilled in persuasion and deception.

Distractible: You have a hard time focusing. You’re hindered in tasks involving knowledge or lore, as well as resisting mental attacks.

Inability: When you’re in water, attacks using weapons are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The other PCs were stranded in a shipwreck, and you saved them.

2\. A factory is polluting your local body of water, and you’re looking for revenge.

3\. You played a prank on the other PCs while they were swimming; after a good laugh, they invited you to join them.

Nix Advancement:

Calm Stranger

Enhanced Speed

Restful Presence

Ruin Lore

Soothe the Savage

Wilderness Life

Sylph

You’re an air spirit, with the gift of wingless flight and hawklike eyes. You’re happiest when you have an aerial view; you lean more toward strategy than action, calling the shots from an unmatched vantage point. Your sensitivity to air currents and atmospheric pressure means you’re able to predict weather patterns, which you incorporate into your machinations.

You gain the following characteristics:

Master Plans: +2 to your Intellect or Speed Pool.

Sylph Flight (2 Intellect or Speed points): You can fly a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action, for up to ten minutes total. Enabler.

Top-Down Strategy: You’re skilled in logistics and planning.

Sharp Vision: You’re trained in visual perception.

Oncoming Storm (1 Intellect point): You can predict weather patterns (approaching storm systems, cloud cover, wind direction) for the next twelve hours. Action.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You saw the other PCs headed toward danger and called out a warning before the situation turned sour.

2\. You got in trouble for flying in restricted airspace, and the other PCs helped cover for you.

3\. You need help with a spell that will enable you to communicate with birds of prey.

4\. You helped the other PCs recover a kite that became tangled in tree branches and power lines.

Sylph Advancement:

Enhanced Intellect

Enhanced Speed

Eyes Adjusted

Influence Swarm

Precision

Shock

Unmagical

You’re not good at using magic. In fact, it’s clear that you’re inherently unmagical—magic is as confusing, difficult, and awkward for you as learning lava spells would be for a frost giant. It’s not that you don’t believe in magic (though maybe you don’t) or that you don’t like magic (though maybe you don’t). It’s just that you and magic are incompatible. You’ve learned to compensate for this problem and even turn it into an advantage in some cases.

An Unmagical character shouldn’t be able to overcome their inability by becoming trained in magic. The GM might allow them to train away part of the inability with training in specific skills, such as “Onslaught” or “magical weapons.”

Playing an Adept or Speaker character with the Unmagical descriptor is a challenge, as their abilities mostly stem from supernatural power and therefore all of them would be hindered. This descriptor is mainly for Warriors and Explorers who want to play up their not inherently magical nature.

You gain the following characteristics.

Make Do With the Mundane: +1 to each of your Pools.

Resistant to Magic: You are trained in all defense rolls against magic, spells, and magical effects.

Inability: All actions using magic (including casting spells and using magic objects) are hindered.

Magical Failure: Your unmagical nature means magic goes awry more often. For any task relating to or interacting with magic, you trigger a GM intrusion on a d20 roll of 1 or 2.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs initially diagnosed you as unmagical, which made a lot of your life suddenly make sense.

2\. You think this group of PCs might be on track to figuring out why some people are unmagical and perhaps “fixing” them.

3\. You and the other PCs have the same rival or foe—someone who once tried using magic on you and failed spectacularly.

4\. You volunteered because you knew your inherent resistance to magic would be useful to the group.

## FOCI AND CHARACTER ABILITIES

This section presents new foci that can be used as-is in most modern fantasy campaigns. Each of them has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for other genres). The GM and player should adjust these details to suit the specific campaign they’ll be playing.

Codes Magic Apps

You are a maker, a crafter, but you use a unique combination of code and magic instead of wood, steel, or circuit boards. Like anyone who’s spent a lot of time working on a computer, you’ve learned some strange secrets, not all of them entirely legal, and you know a lot about games, people, and how things work. More than just a computer nerd, you’re a developer and (although you might not admit it) a hacker. Most of your specialized gear is hardware or software for your computer or smart device, so you can dress however you want. You’re probably used to wearing comfortable clothes, sitting for hours at a time, and enjoying many caffeinated beverages (that have permanently discolored some of your clothing).

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. You once created a magical app to help get them out of a sticky situation (parking ticket, failing grade, clingy relationship, and so on).

2\. Pick one other PC. You know they know an embarrassing or incriminating secret about you.

3\. Pick one other PC. Something about this person annoys or distracts you so that when they’re within immediate range, your tasks with computers and magical lore are hindered.

4\. Pick one other PC. Every now and then, you’re able to copy a magical app cypher and send it to them (effectively creating a duplicate of one of yours).

Additional Equipment: Computer (laptop or desktop) and a smartphone or tablet.

Minor Effect Suggestion: Your next use of a magical app cypher within the next hour is eased.

Major Effect Suggestion: Your next use of a magical app cypher within the next day is eased.

Tier 1:

Magical Programmer: You are trained in crafting magical apps and in using (and exploiting) computer software. You know one or more computer languages well enough to write basic programs, and you are fluent in internet protocol. Enabler.

Tier 2:

App Tinkerer: If you spend at least one day tinkering with a magical app in your possession, it functions at one level higher than normal. This applies to all magical apps in your possession, but they retain this bonus only for you. Enabler.

Connected

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Confidence Artist or Master Magical Programmer as your tier 3 ability.

Confidence Artist

Master Magical Programmer: You are specialized in crafting magical apps and in using (and exploiting) computer software. Enabler.

Tier 4:

Magical App Hacker: All magical app cyphers you use function at one level higher than normal. If given a week, you can tinker with one of your magical app cyphers, transforming it into another magical app cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical—for example, a magical app that creates a fiery explosion probably can’t be turned into a healing app. Enabler.

Tier 5:

Knowing the Unknown

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Call in Favor or Usurp Cypher as your tier 6 ability.

Call in Favor

Usurp Cypher

Conjures Bullets

You blend sorcery and firearms into an amazing mix of magic and technology. Bullets and spells are almost interchangeable to you; your magic has a firearm motif and you cast using your gun. You might be a trick-shot sorcerer, a magical member of the armed forces, or an outlaw with a flair for arcane power. Gun nuts and wizard purists might look down on your blended technique, but you can do things that nobody else can do. You might call yourself a guncaster, spellshooter, or triggermage. You wear clothing that leaves your arms and hands free to use your weapon and cast spells, preferring something more flashy than a gunslinger’s long coat and more intimidating than typical magician or witch clothing.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. You once grazed this character with one of your spell bullets; it’s up to them whether they’ve forgiven you or still resent you for it.

2\. Pick one other PC. You’ve accidentally discovered that you can shoot their spells out of your gun just like you do with your own spells, but the PC must be touchingyour gun while you fire it.

3\. Pick one other PC. Based on your interactions, you think this character resents your use of guns, magic, or both.

4\. Pick one other PC. This character can barely hear your gunshots (magical or otherwise), which are no louder than a whisper to them.

Additional Equipment: Medium or heavy handgun.

Minor Effect Suggestion: The attack hits the side of the foe’s head, deafening them for a few minutes.

Major Effect Suggestion: The foe’s major blood vessel is hit, causing them to bleed 1 point of damage each round until someone succeeds at a difficulty 3 Intellect or Speed task to bind the wound.

Tier 1:

Practiced With Guns

Spell Bullet: In your hands, a typical handgun or rifle never needs to be loaded because you can automatically conjure a standard bullet for it as part of your attack action with that weapon.

Alternatively, instead of casting a spell in the normal manner, you can channel it through your handgun, firing it like a bullet. This is as loud as firing a normal bullet and uses the handgun’s range (typically long) if that is longer than the spell’s normal range. If the spell is an attack spell, instead of making an Intellect-based attack you make a Speed-based attack; assets and skill with guns apply to the attack, and you use your Speed Pool if you apply Effort to ease the attack. This means you use Intellect to cast the spell (and for applying Effort for additional effects or extra damage) and Speed for the attack roll (using Intellect Edge and Speed Edge for their respective Pools). Enabler.

You can use Spell Bullet to cast a spell that affects multiple targets. This might look like you’re firing multiple times or the one shot is passing through or ricocheting off each target.

Tier 2:

Gun Jammer (2+ Intellect points): You can interfere with a firearm so the next time it is used, it jams or misfires. The weapon must be within short range and you must be able to see it. Make an Intellect-based attack against the weapon or its bearer (whichever level is higher). If you succeed, the next attack with the firearm fails, and the weapon won’t fire until someone uses an action to correct the problem. If you activate this ability when it isn’t your turn, your attack against the weapon is hindered. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more firearms; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action or enabler.

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Iron Eye or Trained Guncasting as your tier 3 ability.

Iron Eye: You inflict an additional 3 points of damage with any single-target attack spell cast through a firearm using Spell Bullet. If the attack spell doesn’t inflict damage, you instead can modify the spell as if you had applied a level of Intellect Effort to it. Enabler.

Trained Guncasting: You are trained in using guns (whether firing normal bullets or Spell Bullets). Enabler.

Tier 4:

Hasty Guncasting: You can make two gun attacks as a single action; one is a spell (using Spell Bullet) and the other is a normal gunshot. You can make these attacks in either order, but the second one is hindered by two steps. Enabler.

Tier 5:

Bullet Jaunt (5 Intellect points): Every Spell Bullet you fire leaves a faint path of magic that you can see and follow. Choose the path of one Spell Bullet within long range that you fired in the past minute; you instantly teleport to any place you want along its path. Alternatively, you can use Spell Bullet to conjure a standard bullet, fire it at a target within gun range, and jaunt as part of the action of firing the bullet. Action to teleport along an existing path or to fire a bullet and teleport along its path.

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Deadeye or Special Shot as your tier 6 ability.

Deadeye: You inflict an additional 6 points of damage with any single-target attack spell cast through a firearm using Spell Bullet. If the attack spell doesn’t inflict damage, you instead can modify the spell as if you had applied two levels of Intellect Effort to it. If you have the Iron Eye ability, you can exchange it for Trained Guncasting. Enabler.

Special Shot

Hunts Witches

You know enough about magic to mistrust anyone who uses it, especially witches—people who study ancient rituals, make pacts with evil creatures, and use their power for personal gain. Warped by their abilities, they are dangerous threats to regular folks, and it’s up to people like you to find and eliminate those threats. Sure, some witches claim to be good and even act friendly, but you’ve seen it go bad all too often, and you won’t be fooled again. You always carry weapons for fighting witches, or at least know what common tools will do as a weapon in a pinch. You wear clothing appropriate to the region and era (especially if regular people don’t know about magic or witches and you have to hide what you do). You may have a token, icon, or other reminder of your purpose, such as a lucky coin, a holy book, or a pouch of magic-thwarting herbs given to you by your mentor.

What a “witch” is depends on the setting. In a setting where magic is rare or secret, superstitious people might consider anyone who uses magic to be a dangerous witch. In a different setting, “witch” might refer to a specific organization of people who know how to use magic.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. You are friends, and you’d hate to see anything bad happen to them.

2\. Pick one other PC. You know that some mysterious quality about them makes witches tend to choose them as targets over other people.

3\. Pick one other PC. You know they’ve had a run-in with a witch before, and you want to hear how that played out.

4\. Pick one other PC. You’ve known this person quite a while, and in fact it was a witch attack against them that convinced you to start hunting witches.

Additional Equipment: A book of lore about witches, passed down to you from past witch hunters and updated over the years (or decades or centuries) with their advice and discoveries about witches.

Minor Effect Suggestion: You intimidate your foe so much that they pause, taking no action on their next turn (but they’re still able to defend themselves).

Major Effect Suggestion: You are so intimidating that your foe chooses to flee, or at least retreat a bit to recover its courage and think of a new strategy.

Tier 1:

Witch Bane: You inflict 1 additional point of damage with weapons. When you inflict damage to witches (or other intelligent creatures who cast spells), you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Witch Lore: You are trained in the traditional names, habits, suspected lairs, and related topics regarding the witches of your world. You know enough of at least one quasi-magical language (such as Latin or Ancient Greek) that you can make yourself understood to them. Enabler.

Tier 2:

Will of Legend

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Improved Witch Bane or Misdirect as your tier 3 ability.

Improved Witch Bane: When you inflict damage to witches (or other intelligent creatures who cast spells), you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Misdirect

Tier 4:

Countercharm (5 Intellect points): If you are affected by an unwanted ongoing magical condition or affliction (such as a curse, paralysis spell, withering hex, and so on) that gives you additional rolls to end it early, your rolls to end it early are eased by two steps until you break free. Enabler.

Tier 5:

Greater Skill with Attacks

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Hard to Kill or Heroic Witch Bane as your tier 6 ability.

Hard to Kill

Heroic Witch Bane: When you inflict damage to witches (or other intelligent creatures who cast spells), you inflict 3 additional points of damage. Enabler.

Inks Spells on Skin

Your enchanted heritage is etched upon you. Studying strange formulas, mystic runes, and magical glyphs to learn spells is one thing. Making spells truly a part of you is another, but that’s exactly what you do when you apply magical inks to create intricate spell tattoos across your body. Each tattoo you inscribe on yourself is not merely a design, but the keystone of a spell, giving you the ability to cast it. Because your tattoos are magical, you can continually add to those you’ve already accumulated without ruining the designs, allowing your mastery over magic to grow. You often wear clothing that bares your arms and perhaps other parts of your body to expose your tattoos, so that others know you for a spellcaster.

Readying Spell Tattoos: You learn two abilities (spells) at every tier of this focus, and each of them becomes a tattoo on your body. However, for each tier’s spells, you can only have one of the two readied (available for casting) at any given time, and the other is merely an interesting design until you change your readied spell for that tier. To change one readied spell, immediately after using a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll, you must spend one minute in meditation, after which you can swap one readied spell.

The Inks Spells on Skin focus works similarly to the Masters Spells focus. The GM may consider allowing characters with either of these foci to choose abilities from either focus when they advance to a new tier.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. They once broke a bottle of one of your magical tattoo inks. It’s up to you if you’ve forgiven them or not.

2\. Pick one other PC. You think they could learn your tattoo magic, and you’d like to teach them. They may or may not be interested in learning it.

3\. Pick one other PC. Whenever you ready your spells for the day, this character feels faint pain on their body where your corresponding tattoo is.

4\. Pick one other PC. This character asked you to give them a tattoo, so you did. Somehow, now you can always sense their general direction and distance from you.

Additional Equipment: Special ink, a tattooing needle, and a clay, stone, or wooden tablet marked with strange glyphs.

Minor Effect Suggestion: Exposed skin on the target creature is marked with a glowing glyph of your choice for one hour.

Major Effect Suggestion: The foe is cursed, hindering all their actions for one minute.

Tier 1:

Fleet of Foot

Poison Touch (2 Intellect points): You touch a creature and lines of poison crawl through their skin. They take 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are hindered on their next turn. Action.

Tier 2:

Eclipse (2 Intellect points): You drain the light from an immediate area within long range. Bright light (like a sunny day outdoors) becomes dim light, normal light (like inside a well-lit room) becomes very dim light, and anything darker becomes darkness. If you cast this spell on an object, the darkness moves with the object, and can be suppressed if it is enclosed in a light-proof container or wrapping. Action.

Mist Form (4 Intellect points): You change into a cloud of mist for up to ten minutes, filling an immediate area. You gain an asset to sneaking tasks and Speed defense tasks, but you lose the benefit of any armor you wear. You can pass through any barrier that allows air to move through it (such as a fence, wire screen, cloth, or pipe), moving up to an immediate distance each round. You can’t affect or be affected by normal matter, but energy attacks (like fire or explosions) and mental attacks still affect you. You cannot speak but can still use abilities that don’t rely on human speech or affecting physical matter (other than yourself). If large portions of the mist are separated (such as behind a closed door) when you return to human form, you move one step down the damage track. Action to change or revert.

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose any two of the following as your tier 3 ability: Command, Lightning Flash, or Outwit.

Command

Lightning Flash (4+ Intellect points): Lightning strikes within long range, filling an immediate area and inflicting 3 points of damage on all affected creatures. Effort applied to one attack counts for all attacks against targets in the area of the flash. Even on an unsuccessful attack, a creature in the area still takes 1 point of damage. Your attack is eased against targets wearing, carrying, or made of a significant amount of metal. Action.

Outwit

Tier 4:

Elemental Protection

Incapacitate (4 Intellect points): You use necromantic magic to make one creature in short range fall prone and be unable to take actions for one round. Action.

Tier 5:

Bypass Barrier

Granite Wall

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose any two of the following as your tier 6 ability: Divide Your Mind, Petrify, or Summon Demon.

Divide Your Mind

Petrify (6+ Intellect points): You slowly transform a creature within short range into lifeless stone. The target must be level 2 or lower. If your attack succeeds, the creature takes 6 points of damage and moves one step down the damage track as their flesh begins to mineralize. If the transformation is not interrupted by the end of your next turn, the creature fully becomes a harmless stone statue. You can cast this spell to restore a petrified target back into their living self. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to petrify a level 6 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort. Action.

Summon Demon

Is A Car Wizard

Your skill behind the wheel is legendary, combining natural talent and specialized magic to perform stunts and tricks that are impossible for regular people. Nothing beats the feel of wind in your hair, except maybe the intense purr of a finely tuned engine augmented by sorcery. You love pushing yourself (and your vehicle) to the limit, even if it’s dangerous—better to die a legend than live a long, dull life driving something boring. You enjoy drawing attention to yourself, so you tend to wear sleek clothing, stylish sunglasses, and borderline-gaudy jewelry, but never anything that interferes with your ability to control a car or cast a spell.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. To repay a favor they did for you a while ago, you promised to drive them somewhere. They haven’t taken you up on it yet.

2\. Pick one other PC. You were the getaway driver for them once in the past— perhaps for something criminal, a car stunt for a viral video, or to avoid a bad situation.

3\. Pick one other PC. You know they were once in a very bad car collision that left the vehicle a wreck, but they somehow weren’t hurt at all.

4\. Pick one other PC. They used to associate with someone who was trying to hunt you down, but they haven’t been in contact with that person in a while.

Additional Equipment: A reasonably fast car.

Minor Effect Suggestion: The foe you hit (with your spell or car) is moved horizontally an immediate distance in a direction of your choice.

Major Effect Suggestion: The foe is knocked prone and loses their next action.

Tier 1:

Driver

Tier 2:

One Hand on the Wheel: As an action, you can cast a one-action spell and attempt a driving task. Enabler.

Car Magic (3+ Intellect points): You can alter a magical ability you cast so it also affects the vehicle you’re driving, as if it were a part of you. For example, if you’re driving and you cast Hover on yourself, you and the car begin to float; if you cast Invisibility on yourself, you and the car turn invisible. Spells cast on a car this way tend to last only a few rounds before expiring (although the spell still lasts its full duration on you). The cost of Car Magic is added to the cost of the spell you’re casting. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect other creatures within the car; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to two additional creatures in the car. Enabler.

The main reason to cast Hover on a moving car is to make awesome-looking jumps that would be impossible without ramps, magic, or Hollywood special effects.

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Expert Driver or Perfect Parking Space as your tier 3 ability.

Expert Driver

1Perfect Parking Space (3 Intellect points):

You can send your car into a pocket dimension that moves with you and is just large enough to hold it. Nobody other than you can perceive or access this space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to store the car if you and the car have more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the car while it’s in the space harms you, and so on. Storing or retrieving the car happens over one minute as it slowly (and visibly) vanishes or reappears; you can reduce this time to just one round if you succeed at a level 4 Intellect task. Action to initiate.

Tier 4:

Enhanced Intellect

Tier 5:

Deer in the Headlights: When you cast an attack spell while driving, you can modify the spell as if you had applied two levels of Intellect Effort to it. Enabler.

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Spells Have No Speed Limit or Trick Driver as your tier 6 ability.

Spells Have No Speed Limit: Any car you have driven for at least a minute responds to you like a well-trained robot, allowing you to mentally give it orders from a long distance away. This control

includes any aspect of driving the car (such as steering, accelerating, and braking) and any moveable parts on the car (such as opening or closing the doors, hood, or trunk). The car takes actions on your turn, and you make rolls for it in combat or when it takes actions. You can only control one car at a time with this ability (although you could manually drive one car and magically

control another car at the same time). If you are driving the car you’re controlling with this ability, your driving tasks and extreme tricks with the car (such as jumping a ravine or other vehicle, spinning in the air, landing safely on another vehicle, and so on) are eased. Enabler.

Trick Driver

Learned From the Classics

Magic comes intuitively to some people, but you’ve always had to work a bit harder. Luckily, you find that research comes naturally. You know what questions to ask; you know which books, websites, or professionals will have the answers. You spent years studying and practicing, and you taught yourself everything you know. Now you’re a skilled magician who’s always eager to learn more—evidenced by your lengthy reading list.

Connection: Choose one of the following or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1\. Pick one other PC. They appreciate (but do not necessarily share) your obsession with books, libraries, and research.

2\. Pick one other PC. You once owed this character a lot of money (or vice versa), although that debt is now paid.

3\. Pick one other PC. They remind you about an obscure author whose books you enjoy, and you can’t help but like them.

4\. Pick one other PC. You think this person is woefully ignorant about a lot of important topics (history, magic, ethics, and so on).

Minor Effect Suggestion: You gain a burst of insight, easing your next action by one step.

Major Effect Suggestion: Your knowledge lets you tap into an obscure current of magic and make a free recovery roll as part of your current action.

Tier 1:

Enhanced Intellect

Library Life: When a problem needs solving, you may not know the solution, but you know where to look. You are trained in research. Enabler.

Tier 2:

Flex Skill

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Enhanced Intellect Edge or Repeated Rituals as your tier 3 ability.

Enhanced Intellect Edge

Repeated Rituals: If you’ve successfully completed a ritual in the past, tasks for performing that ritual again are eased by two steps. Enabler

Tier 4:

Knowing the Unknown

Tier 5:

Mind of a Leader

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Greater Enhanced Intellect or Mental Magic as your tier 6 ability.

Greater Enhanced Intellect

Mental Magic: When attempting a magic-based Might or Speed task, you can instead roll as if it were an Intellect action. This means that if you apply Effort, you spend points from your Intellect Pool and use your Intellect Edge. Enabler.

Practices Moon Magic

The moon is a powerful force on the world, in terms of both science and magic. She hangs overhead like a watchful eye, makes creatures act strangely, represents cycles of time, and causes the ebb and flow of the tides. To you, she is a friend, an inspiration, and a constant reminder that someone is watching over you. You wield her magic to create beams of dangerous light, influence others, travel, and sense the underlying truth and reality of things. The day is not your foe (after all, the moon is often visible during the day), but you prefer the night when the moon can be the brightest light in the sky. You might call yourself a moonchild or a moon witch. You probably prefer black, white, or grey clothing, with flowing portions such as long sleeves, a cape, or a long coat. You might have one or more tattoos or tokens representing the moon, either full, crescent, or in multiple phases. Your favorite jewelry and adornments (like buttons) usually have moonstones.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. You can harmlessly bounce your moon spells off them, increasing your range by a short distance and even allowing you to shoot around corners.

2\. Pick one other PC. You know they think your obsession with the moon is weird, pointless, or superstitious, and you feel the need to prove them wrong.

3\. Pick one other PC. Sometimes you can’t detect them with any of your senses or affect them with your magic, even when they’re right in front of you.

4\. Pick one other PC. Your power and theirs have an unusual connection; instead of using your one-action recovery roll on yourself, you can use it on them (and vice versa).

Minor Effect Suggestion: Your foe is dazzled by a burst of moonlight, hindering them for one round.

Major Effect Suggestion: A surge of lunar power knocks your foe prone and disarms them of an object they’re holding, which lands an immediate distance away.

Tier 1:

Moonbeam (1+ Intellect point): You emit a cone of pale, cool moonlight from your hand, illuminating up to a short distance with dim light, lasting for one minute. As your action or as part of the action of activating this ability, you can tighten the beam so it focuses on one creature, inflicting either 4 points of cold damage or 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor), which immediately ends the spell. You automatically know if the struck creature is a shapechanger (such as a werewolf), although this doesn’t tell you what kind of shapechanger they are or what their true form is. Action.

Tier 2:

Eyes Adjusted

Inspire Aggression

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Nightstrike or Spur Effort as your tier 3 ability. Whichever one you choose, you also gain Moon Adaptation.

Nightstrike

Spur Effort

Moon Adaptation: You can survive indefinitely in a vacuum environment (such as the moon or space).

Although Moon Adaptation protects you from the airless environment of the moon, people traveling with you aren’t so lucky—unless you teleport directly to a pressurized location such as a moon base or an abandoned NASA vehicle.

Tier 4:

Moonlight Barrage (4+ Intellect points): You call down dozens of rays of moonlight into an adjacent short area. All within the area take 4 points of damage from mystical cold and glow with faint moonlight equivalent to a candle for one minute (a creature can end this glow early as an action or by entering an area that moonlight cannot penetrate, such as a deep cave or a room with no windows). You automatically know if any creature in the area is a shapechanger (such as a

werewolf), although this doesn’t tell you what kind of shapechanger they are or what their true form is. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than to ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Action.

Tier 5:

Moon Portal (6+ Intellect points): You instantaneously transmit yourself to any location on Earth, as long as moonlight is shining on you and on the spot you want to be. Alternatively, you can instantaneously transport yourself from Earth to the moon or back again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to three additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action.

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Precognition or True Senses as your tier 6 ability.

Precognition

True Senses

Steers The Coven

Magic is strongest when wielded by a community. The strength of a community is derived from the strength of its leader, and you’ve taken on the role. Maybe you were chosen, or maybe you volunteered. Maybe you have an official title and responsibilities, or maybe you serve as an informal mentor. Maybe you run a coven with bylaws and a charter, or maybe you host gatherings where your friends and family can perform rituals together. Regardless, you’re responsible for a coalition of magicians who look to you for guidance, protection, and problem-solving.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. You have a friendly rivalry with this person, perhaps due to philosophical differences or belonging to another coven with contrary goals.

2\. Pick one other PC. You want to learn more about this person so you can decide if they should join your coven or are somehow a threat to it.

3\. Pick one other PC. Long ago you were very close to this character, but you drifted apart. You’ll need to decide if you’re starting anew or trying to rekindle the old friendship.

4\. Pick one other PC. This character or someone they care about is in your coven, and you feel responsible for protecting them.

Minor Effect Suggestion: The evident power of the support from your coven intimidates a foe, who retreats a short distance away on their next turn.

Major Effect Suggestion: Your opponent respects your commitment to your coven so much that they withdraw from the conflict (although they may return later).

Tier 1:

Community Activist

Community Knowledge

Tier 2:

Shepherd’s Fury

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Inspire Action or True Guardian as your tier 3 ability.

Inspire Action

True Guardian

Tier 4:

Ritual Guidance: When you participate in a magical ritual with two or more members of your coven, ritual tasks for all participants are eased by two steps. Enabler

Tier 5:

Protective Instincts (6+ Might, Speed, or Intellect points): When engaging in combat to defend your coven or home, you can attack up to five different foes with a single action as long as they are within immediate range of each other. All the attacks must be the same sort of attack (melee, ranged, or spell), and the point cost of this ability is deducted from whichever Pool the attack uses. Pay the costs (if any) separately for each attack, and make a separate attack roll for each foe. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all attacks. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply to one action. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the number of foes you can attack, with one additional foe per level of Effort. Enabler.

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Deep Consideration or Drawing on Life’s Experiences as your tier 6 ability.

Deep Consideration

Drawing on Life’s Experiences

Transmits Energy

Magic is often compared to electromagnetism: it’s an invisible and ubiquitous force that holds everything together. Magic runs through every living creature, the ground, and even the air around us. You can sense—and influence—the flow of power, the way some people can hear currents running through wire. In a crisis, you attack by draining a foe’s energy. Otherwise, you focus on helping others by catalyzing and enhancing their magic abilities.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. This character thinks you’re some sort of energy vampire, either dangerous or just annoying.

2\. Pick one other PC. You believe they have insight about how to master your magic, if you can just convince them to trust you with their secrets.

3\. Pick one other PC. You once knocked out this character with your power, but were able to jolt them back awake again. At the time they seemed to think it was funny.

4\. Pick one other PC. You once recharged one of their powerful cyphers, although you’re not sure how you managed it.

Minor Effect Suggestion: You gently drain 2 points of energy from your foe, which you can divide between your Might and Speed Pools.

Major Effect Suggestion: You gently drain 5 points of energy from your foe, which you can divide between your Might and Speed Pools.

Tier 1:

Lend a Hand: If an ally attempts a magical task and fails, they can try again without spending Effort if you help them. You provide this advantage to your friend even if you are not trained in the task that they’re retrying. Enabler.

Tier 2:

Drain Creature

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Buddy System or Tap Currents as your tier 3 ability.

Buddy System

Tap Currents: You can draw energy from the earth itself into your body. If you concentrate and don’t move from where you’re standing for one minute, you restore 3 points to your Might or Speed Pool. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve made a ten-hour recovery roll. If you have the Store Energy ability, you can instead use Tap Currents to add 3 points to your Siphon Pool. (This use of this ability is not limited to one use per ten-hour recovery roll.) Action to initiate.

Tier 4:

Store Energy

Tier 5:

Share the Power

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Explosive Release or both Continuous Transfer and Drain at a Distance at tier 6.

Explosive Release

Continuous Transfer: When you use either Drain Creature or Tap Currents to drain energy, you can transfer it to another creature within short range, restoring points to their Might or Speed Pools (or health for an NPC). This occurs seamlessly, as part of the same action. Enabler.

Drain at a Distance

Turns Decay to Growth

You’re comfortable with decomposition: the bacteria and fungi that break down organic material are living creatures, and you coax magic from the interplay of life and death. To you, rot isn’t cause for revulsion—it’s an opportunity to build something new. Maggots, mushrooms, and mold are actors in your process, not unlike familiars. You probably keep a garden, nourished by your meticulously maintained compost pile. Your community might express discomfort with your methods, leading to friction. If you react to criticism by isolating yourself, you won’t be lonely for very long—what you have to offer is vital and rare, and it’s inevitable that someone will ask you for help.

Connection:

1\. Pick one other PC. This character dislikes the smell that your spells make and tries to be at least an immediate distance away when you cast them.

2\. Pick one other PC. This character is fascinated by your powers and wants to make use of them (or just thinks you can provide them with medicinal mushrooms).

3\. Pick one other PC. This character believes you are a member of a mushroom cult (which to them might be a good, bad, or neutral thing).

4\. Pick one other PC. You and this character have a magical connection, and you each add +1 to your recovery rolls when within a short distance of each other.

Minor Effect Suggestion: Your foe is dazed (hindered) for the next round.

Major Effect Suggestion: Your foe is stunned for one round, or you restore 2 points to any one of your Pools.

Tier 1:

Wilderness Lore

Spore Cloud (1 Intellect point): You throw a handful of mushrooms that speed toward a target within long range. The attack inflicts 3 points of damage and envelops the target in a haze of toxic spores, which inflicts 1 additional point of damage per round (ignores Armor) for the next minute or until the target uses an action to wash the spores away. Action.

Tier 2:

Wilderness Explorer

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Reading Decomposition or both Grasping Foliage and Necromancy at tier 3.

Reading Decomposition (3 Intellect points): You gain knowledge about an area by reading energy released by decomposition and decay. You can ask the GM a single, matter-of-fact question about the location and get an answer if you succeed on the Intellect roll. “What was the last ritual performed in this room?” is a good example of a simple question. “Why was this room used for a ritual?” is not an appropriate question, because it has more to do with the mindset of whoever performed the ritual than with qualities of the room. Simple questions usually have a difficulty of 2, but technical questions or those that involve facts meant to be kept secret can have a much higher difficulty. Action.

Unless an environment is absolutely sterilized, there are enough microbes, fungal spores, and other organic debris in an area to allow you to use Reading Decomposition.

Grasping Foliage

Necromancy

Tier 4:

If you have Necromancy, your tier 4 ability is Greater Necromancy. If you have Reading Decomposition, your tier 4 ability is Rewind Rot.

Greater Necromancy

Rewind Rot: Your grasp on life and death energy means that you can heal—even from death—as long as your head, heart, and hands remain intact. One minute after descending a step on the damage track, you regain 2 Pool points. However, if you return from death, it is with a permanent 2-point reduction in your Intellect Pool. Enabler.

Tier 5:

Insect Eruption

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Restore Life or Word of Death as your tier 6 ability.

Restore Life

Word of Death

## NEW ABILITIES (MODERN MAGIC)

Access the Broadcast (2+ Intellect points): You create a flat rectangular illusory “screen” within immediate range that can display any broadcast television signal in your area (similar to using a television with an antenna) or any video streams in the area (similar to tapping into a wireless network). The screen is anywhere from 1 to 3 feet (30 cm to 1 m) across, includes stereo sound, and lasts for one hour. As an action, you can change the channel, the volume, or both. The effect ends if you are more than a short distance away from the screen. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the width of the screen by up to 3 feet (1 m). Action.

Wireless networks hosting video streams are usually locked or encrypted, which requires you to succeed on an Intellect-based attack roll against the network’s level (typically level 4) to watch them.

Background Music (1+ Intellect points): You create quiet background music in a short area, loud enough to be heard in a room with normal conversation, but not so loud to be distracting or overwhelming. The music repeats through up to ten songs you know, lasting up to an hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort adds one hour to the play time and five songs to the playlist. Action.

Blackout (3 Intellect points): You issue a disruptive ripple of energy within short range, creating an area where the electrical power grid fails. All devices relying on being plugged into the grid stop working. Battery‑powered devices still work. Any standby generator connected in this area functions normally, activating emergency power within a few rounds. The blackout otherwise lasts for one minute. Action.

Blood Magician: When you wish it, you can use points from your Might Pool rather than your Intellect Pool to activate a magical ability (including applying Effort to that ability). If you use your Might Pool this way, you use your Might Edge instead of your Intellect Edge. Enabler.

Bound Magic Familiar: You have a magic familiar bound to you through a magical mark on your body (a tattoo, rune, scar, or something as mundane as a freckle or mole). Normally, the familiar remains sleeping in its spiritual form. When you use an action to manifest them, they appear next to you as a creature with a specific form (such as a cat, hawk, homunculus, tiny dragon, or other suitable magical creature) and can communicate with you telepathically. The familiar is friendly toward you but has its own personality determined by the GM. The familiar can remain physically manifested for up to one hour, after which they return to their sleeping spiritual form and cannot manifest again until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. While manifested, they accompany you and follow your instructions. The familiar must remain within an immediate distance of you; if they move farther away, they are yanked back into their magical mark at the end of your following turn and cannot return until after your next ten-hour recovery roll. The familiar doesn’t make attacks, but they can use their action to grant you an asset for any one attack you make on your turn. Otherwise, they can take actions on their own (though you’ll likely roll for them). If the familiar is reduced to 0 health, they dissipate into their spiritual form and cannot manifest again until 1d6 + 2 days have passed. Action to manifest the familiar.

Magic familiar: level 3, Speed defense as level 5 due to size, one knowledge skill as level 4

Critter Telekinesis (1 Intellect point): You. telekinetically move a small creature (no larger than a medium dog) an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the creature, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The creature safely arrives at your chosen location without any residual force. If the creature knows you and you have a free hand, you can automatically grab the creature as part of the action of using this ability. This ability lacks the fine control to move anything with much speed, so in most situations, it’s used to reposition an animal (such as a pet) out of a dangerous or inconvenient location. For example, you could safely pull a scared cat out from under a bed, retrieve a puppy from a storm drain, or relocate a wild bird that got inside your house. Action.

Facsimile of Life (3 Intellect points): You give an object limited mobility, awareness, and intellect, allowing it to move about as if it were a small pet. The object must be within immediate distance and no larger than half your size. When animated, the object can perform tasks for you as if it were a level 1 creature, but otherwise is treated as an object of its level (for example, it uses the object damage track instead of health). The animation lasts for an hour or until you and it are at least a long distance apart, at which time the object becomes inert again. Action.

Ghost Car (4+ Intellect points): You create a level 3 ghostly-looking car that can carry two people and a small amount of luggage. You or a creature you designate can drive the car as normal. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, it can carry two additional passengers and its level increases by 1. The car lasts for an hour, after which it vanishes. Action.

Hush (1+ Intellect point): You create a transparent bubble within short range that muffles very loud sounds within it, such as alarms, sirens, leaf blowers, and crying babies. The bubble is about 3 feet (1 m) across and any noise from within it comes out no louder than a normal speaking voice. The bubble lasts for one minute and moves with the target. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to increase the duration; one level of Effort increases the duration to ten minutes, two levels increases it to an hour, and three levels increases it to ten hours. Action.

Magnification (1+ Intellect point): You create a rectangular frame, visible only to you, that doubles the magnification of whatever you see through it. The frame defaults to hovering in front of your face about an arm’s length away, but you can use your action to move it up, down, or to either side. The frame lasts for ten minutes and grants an asset on perception tasks at range. For each level of Effort you apply to this ability, you can increase the magnification by another increment (×3 for one level of Effort, ×4 for two levels of Effort, and so on). Action.

Network Dead Zone (3 Intellect points): You interfere with radio signals, such as Bluetooth, wifi, cell phone service, AM/FM radio, ham radio, and walkie-talkies. Choose a short area within immediate range; all such transmissions into or out of that area are blocked due to a combination of interference and lack of reception. This lasts for one minute. Action.

Powerful radio sources, such as a radio station transmitter or a telecommunication satellite, may be able to punch through a Network Dead Zone spell.

Paralyzing Touch (4+ Intellect points): You gather necromantic energy in your fingertip and touch a creature. A target of level 3 or lower is paralyzed and helpless for an hour. Each level of Effort applied increases the level cap of the target by 1. Action.

Remote Slap (3 Intellect points): You use an active telephone, cellular, internet, or closed-circuit video connection to slap a creature. The target must be actively using a device making use of this connection, such as being on the other end of a phone call or text message, browsing the same social media website or app you’re using, or monitoring a closed-circuit camera that is recording you. Make an Intellect-based attack against the creature; success means the creature takes 1 point of damage, as if they had been telekinetically slapped in the face by the device they’re using. Each additional remote slap against that creature is hindered by an additional step (resetting after one hour). Action.

Share Memory (3 Intellect points): You share a memory of your choice with a willing creature you touch. The length of the shared memory can be no longer than about five minutes, but you can summarize longer memories (such as how you met, courted, and married your partner) with a “montage” that covers the most important details and underlying sentiment. The target experiences the memory as an instantaneous vision, and is aware that it is your memory rather than their own memory or experience. The memory is as vivid and accurate as you personally remember it. Action.

Soul Familiar: You have a soul familiar who accompanies you and follows your instructions. Your soul and their soul are interconnected (or the familiar might actually be a physical manifestation of your soul). The familiar loves and cares for you like the best combination of a pet and a close friend.

The familiar is no larger than a large cat (about 20 pounds, or 9 kg); a typical soul familiar looks like a bird, cat, rat, lizard, snake, or toad, but more unusual forms (such as a tiny demon, dragon, elemental, fey creature, or floating skull) are also possible. You and the GM must work out the details of your familiar, and you’ll probably make rolls for them in combat or when they take actions. The familiar acts on your turn. Their movement is based on their creature type (avian, swimmer, and so on).

You and your familiar can communicate telepathically within long range, or empathically within very long range. Beyond this range, you can only sense each other’s general level of well-being.

Your familiar’s presence within short range counts as an asset for magical tasks that require at least one minute to activate or maintain.

If your familiar is within an immediate distance of you, you can roll any defense task for them, gaining the benefit of your skills, assets, and Effort (the familiar’s Speed defense tasks are eased by two steps due to their size). While within this distance, your familiar also gains the benefit of any ongoing spell you cast on yourself (for example, if you cast a spell on yourself that lets you breathe water, your familiar can breathe water).

Foes can use your soul familiar’s connection to you against you. If a foe is holding or restraining your familiar (or touching it while it is held or restrained by another creature or a device, such as manacles or a cage), the foe’s attacks and defenses against you are eased.

If an attack against your familiar would reduce their health to 0, you can magically intervene so their health is instead reduced to 1 and you move one step down the damage track. If your familiar dies, you move one step down the damage track. If you die, your familiar instantly dies.

You can replace a dead familiar (or revive them, if you have their remains) by performing a magical ritual that takes 1d6 days.

Enabler.

Soul familiar: level 2, Speed defense as level 4 due to size

A soul familiar with an animal form looks like a normal animal—there’s nothing obvious about them to indicate they’re anything other than what they appear to be.

Statue Stasis (3 Intellect points): You transform into a lifelike bronze or stone statue of yourself for a specific period of time (one minute, one hour, ten hours, or twenty-four hours). When in statue form, you are in stasis; you don’t age, can take no actions (other than making recovery rolls while you “sleep”), and gain +10 to Armor against all forms of damage, including damage not normally affected by Armor. If you take enough damage to get through your armor, the stasis effect immediately ends. Action.

SUPERHERO CHARACTER OPTIONS 

## DESCRIPTORS  
This section presents new descriptors meant specifically for a superhero game.

## AMAZING

You have a knack for surprising people— performing impossible athletic feats, sneaking up on someone who’s alert, or instantly reacting to an ambush. You like to make use of these talents to enhance (or rehabilitate) your reputation as a hero prone to spectacular rescues, defeating foes way above your league, and arriving just in time to save the day. Ironically,

in your normal daily life, you’re a little awkward and overlooked.

You gain the following characteristics:

Exceptional: +2 to your Speed Pool, and 2 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.

Skill: You’re trained in initiative and stealth tasks.

Self-Hype: When you apply a level of Effort to a task, you get a free level of Effort. You can do this one time, although the ability is renewed each time you make a one-hour or ten-hour recovery roll.

Inability: Your sudden appearances are startling to regular people. Positive social reactions are hindered (villains and other superheroes aren’t affected by this).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You got in a bit over your head, but another PC’s coincidental arrival gave you just the distraction you needed.

2\. You were tailing someone the other PCs were following and decided to drop in.

3\. You saw that the other PCs were in a fight and chose to help them out.

4\. You had a hunch that something big was about to go down.

## INCREDIBLE

You’re misunderstood, and you might not even think of yourself as a hero, but somehow you keep ending up in situations where your abilities are just what’s needed to prevent disaster. Maybe good luck cancels out just enough of being cursed to count as a win. You’ve saved innocent lives, defeated some really bad people, and perhaps even cheated death a couple of times. Half the time you don’t even know how you did it, but you succeeded at the impossible . . . often with a lot of collateral damage. When you hear police sirens, it’s time to leave, but you know that trouble will find you eventually—and you’ll be ready to smash it.

Strong: +2 to your Might Pool, and 2 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.

Skill: You’re trained in breaking things. Skill: You’re trained in all jumping tasks. Inability: Your destructive reputation or some other reluctance to communicate makes people distrust you. Any task involving social interaction is hindered.

Incredible Action: You can choose to automatically succeed on one task without rolling, as long as the task’s difficulty is no higher than 6. When you do so, however, you also trigger a GM intrusion as if you had rolled a 1. The intrusion doesn’t invalidate the success, but it probably qualifies it in some fashion. You can do this one time, although the ability renews each time you make a ten-hour recovery roll.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs sensed your decent heart and decided to befriend you.

2\. You literally crashed through a wall and ended up in the middle of the other PCs.

3\. One of the other PCs reminds you of someone from your past.

4\. You were feeling lonely and took a risk talking to someone, and so far it’s paying off

## MIGHTY

You have a very impressive physique. Your strength, power, and very importance

are superior. Whether you’re truly the mightiest may be up for debate (and you may have a friendly rivalry about this with other superheroes), but there is no question that you are exceptional. These things make you confident, but you know that you have these physical gifts in order to perform heroic deeds, and unseemly conduct is beneath you.

Very Powerful: +4 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You’re trained in all actions involving lifting and throwing things.

Skill: You’re trained in Might defense tasks.

Healthy: Add 1 to the points you regain when you make a recovery roll.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You joined the other PCs because they would fail without your strength.

2\. You believe this endeavor will earn you a lot of valor.

3\. Another PC asked—rightly—for your help.

4\. An authority figure told you to do this to show you the value of humility.

## SENSATIONAL

The public and the press like you. Maybe you’re photogenic, or you’re inherently nice, or you have really good luck with journalists. Whatever the cause of it, you’re the darling of the media, and whenever you’re seen in public, you generate a lot of positive interest and excitement. (If you don’t have a secret identity, this attention probably also carries over to your day job, which is a mixed blessing.) People know that you’re a hero and that they can count on you to do the right thing—fighting crime, battling injustice, punching evil robots, that kind of stuff. Sometimes being in the public eye so much can be wearying or even a burden, but you know how to use your reputation to set a good example and make the world a better place.

You gain the following characteristics:

Versatile: You get 4 additional points to divide among your stat Pools.

Skill: You’re trained in positive social interactions.

Skill: You’re trained in one skill relating to your current or past career, such as computers, journalism, law, machinery, or medicine.

Popular: The GM can introduce a GM intrusion on you, based on your fame and the public’s perception of you, without awarding you any XP (as if you had rolled a 1 on a d20 roll). However, if this happens, 50 percent of the time, your reputation works to your advantage. Rather than hurting you (much), it helps you, or it hurts your enemies. You get spotted by a guard, but they’re dumbstruck for a moment because you’re even more impressive in person than you are on TV. You attract a crowd of fans, but they slow down the fleeing villain you’re trying to catch. A photographer pesters you for a photo and a quote, but their camera catches something interesting in the background. You and the GM should work together to determine the details. If the GM wishes, they can use GM intrusions based on your fame normally (awarding XP).

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You’re related to one of the other superhero PCs, and decided to help out because of family.

2\. The other PCs relied on your positive reputation to untangle them from a public relations problem, and they invited you along out of gratitude.

3\. The media specifically called you out to fix this problem.

4\. A supervillain chose to make a scene in the hopes of drawing you out.

## UNCANNY

There’s something unusual about you, and it makes other people a little uncomfortable. You know you’re exceptional—gifted, even—and being a bit odd doesn’t make you any less of a person. This uncanny element is a part of you, in your blood, in your DNA. You can’t help it, but you won’t apologize for it. You feel comfortable around other people with similar strangeness, people who’ve experienced the same prejudice that you have; these shared experiences mean they’re your family, perhaps the only family you’ve got.

You gain the following characteristics:

Exceptional: +2 to your Might Pool and +2 to your Speed Pool.

Distinctive Physical Quirk: You have

an unusual physical aspect. Depending on the setting, this can vary greatly; it might be something external and obvious, such as an odd smell or blue hair, or internal and hidden, like having blood type “omega.” Whatever it is, your quirk draws a lot of attention when it’s discovered.

A Sense for the Weird: Sometimes—at the GM’s discretion—an event or person that seems related to your uncanny nature attracts your attention. You can sense it from afar, and if you get within long range of it, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or not.

Skill: You’re trained in either perception tasks or stealth tasks.

Skill: You’re trained in one kind of knowledge related to your quirk, such as olfactory science, mutations, or hematology.

Inability: People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are hindered. (Other people who are unusual like you aren’t affected by this.)

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You felt the objective was someone like you, so you got involved.

2\. Whether the other PCs realize it or not, their mission has to do with your field of knowledge, so you got involved.

3\. As an expert in an unusual kind of knowledge, you were specifically recruited by the other PCs.

4\. You believe one of the other PCs may be uncanny or is related to someone who is.

If the superhero setting has a specific gene or genes responsible for mutant superpowers, Uncanny characters have that gene (perhaps even multiple copies) and can sense others who have it

NEW ABILITIES 

The following are new abilities for the Cypher System, most of which are associated with the new foci in this book.

Advantages of Being Small: You’ve learned how to leverage your strength and accuracy in proportion to your size. Your damage is no longer halved when using Shrink, and climbing and jumping tasks are eased. Enabler.

Ageless: Your body and mind do not age. Unless you are killed by violence (or some outside force such as poison or infection), you will never die. Enabler.

Always Tinkering: If you have any tools and materials at all, and you are carrying fewer cyphers than your limit, you can create a manifest cypher if you have an hour of time to spend. The new cypher is random and always 2 levels lower than normal (minimum 1). It’s also temperamental and fragile. These are called temperamental cyphers. If you give one to anyone else to use, it falls apart immediately, useless. Action to initiate; one hour to complete.

Amazing Copying: You can use Copy Power to copy more powerful abilities. In addition to the normal options for using Effort with Copy Power, if you apply two levels of Effort, the GM chooses a high-tier ability that most closely resembles that power (instead of a low-tier ability). Enabler.

Amazing Leap (2 Might points): You leap through the air and land safely some distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you choose within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. If you have three or more power shifts in strength, your leaping range increases to very long. If you have five or more power shifts in strength, your leaping range increases to 1,000 feet (300 m). Action.

Animal Scrying (4+ Intellect points): If you know the general location of an animal that is friendly toward you and within 1 mile (1.5 km) of your location, you can sense through its senses for up to ten minutes. If you are not in animal form or not in a form similar to that animal, you must apply a level of Effort to use this ability. Action to establish.

Animal Shape (3+ Intellect points): You change into an animal as small as a rat or up to your own size (such as a large dog or small bear) for ten minutes. Each time you transform, you can take a different animal shape. Your equipment becomes part of the transformation, rendering it unusable unless it has a passive effect, such as armor. In this form your stats remain the same as your normal form, but you can move and attack according to your animal shape (attacks from most animals this size are medium weapons, which you can use without penalty). Tasks requiring hands (such as using door handles or pushing buttons) are hindered when in animal form. You cannot speak but can still use abilities that don’t rely on human speech. You gain two minor abilities associated with the creature you become (see the Animal Form Minor Abilities table). For example, if you transform into a bat, you become trained in perception and can fly up to a long distance each round. If you transform into an octopus, you are trained in stealth and can breathe underwater.

If you apply a level of Effort when you use this ability, you can either become

a talking animal or take a hybrid shape. The talking animal shape looks exactly

like a normal animal, but you can still talk and use any abilities that rely on human speech. The hybrid shape is like your normal form but with animalistic features, even if that animal is something much smaller than you (such as a bat or rat). In this hybrid form you can speak, use all of your abilities, make attacks like an animal, and perform tasks using hands without being hindered. Anyone who sees you clearly in this hybrid form would never mistake you for a mere animal.

Action to change or revert.

Even if your animal shape has multiple attack types (such as claws and bite), you can attack only once per round unless you have some other ability that lets you make additional attacks on your turn.

A character might be able to take the shape of a creature that is similar to a common animal, such as a unicorn instead of a horse or a basilisk instead of a lizard, but doing so should require applying at least one level of Effort to the change, and the character wouldn’t gain any of the creature’s unusual abilities.

Animal Shape variant: If your character concept is that you always take the same animal form instead of being able to choose from multiple kinds of animals, double the duration of the Animal Shape ability (to twenty minutes per use). The GM may allow characters with this restriction to learn additional animal forms by spending 4 XP as a long-term benefit.

## ANIMAL FORM MINOR ABILITIES TABLE

Use the following as examples or suggestions of what a character gains when in the shape of an animal. If an animal shape lists two skills, the character chooses which one they want each time they take that shape.

| Animal            | Skill Training         | Other Abilities |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Ape               | Climbing               | Hands           |
| Badger            | Climbing               | Scent           |
| Bat               | Perception             | Flying          |
| Bear              | Climbing               | Scent           |
| Bird              | Perception             | Flying          |
| Boar              | Might defense          | Scent           |
| Cat               | Climbing or stealth    | Small           |
| Constrictor snake | Climbing               | Constrict       |
| Crocodile         | Stealth or swimming    | Constrict       |
| Deinonychus       | Perception             | Fast            |
| Dolphin           | Perception or swimming | Fast            |
| Fish              | Stealth or swimming    | Aquatic         |
| Frog              | Jumping or stealth     | Aquatic         |
| Horse             | Perception             | Fast            |
| Leopard           | Climbing or stealth    | Fast            |
| Lizard            | Climbing or stealth    | Small           |
| Octopus           | Stealth                | Aquatic         |
| Shark             | Swimming               | Aquatic         |
| Turtle            | Might defense          | Armor           |
| Venomous snake    | Climbing               | Venom           |
| Wolf              | Perception             | Scent           |

Aquatic: The animal either breathes water instead of air or is able to breathe water in addition to breathing air.

Armor: The animal has a thick hide or shell, granting +1 to Armor.

Constrict: The animal can grip its opponent fast after making a melee attack (usually with a bite or claw), easing attack rolls against that foe on later turns until it releases the foe.

Fast: The animal can move a long distance on its turn instead of a short distance.

Flying: The animal can fly, which (depending on the type of animal) may be up to a short or long distance on its turn.

Hands: The animal has paws or hands that are nearly as agile as those of a human. Unlike with most animal shapes, the animal’s tasks that require hands are not hindered (although the GM may decide that some tasks requiring human agility, such as playing a flute, are still hindered).

Scent: The animal has a strong sense of smell, gaining an asset on tracking and dealing with darkness or blindness.

Small: The animal is considerably smaller than a human, easing its Speed defense tasks but hindering tasks to move heavy things.

Venom: The animal is poisonous (usually through a bite), inflicting 1 additional point of damage.

Automatic Glow: Hard light objects you create with your type and focus abilities shed light, illuminating everything in immediate range. Whenever you want, your body (entirely or just part of it) sheds light, illuminating everything in short range. Enabler.

Beneath Notice: Your decreased size makes it difficult to find you. While Shrink is active on you, all stealth tasks you attempt are eased. Enabler.

Bigger Animal Shape: When you use Animal Shape, your animal form grows to about twice its normal size. Being so large, your beast form gains the following additional bonuses: +1 to Armor, +5 to your Might Pool, and you are trained in using your animal form’s natural attacks as heavy weapons (if you weren’t already). However, your Speed defense tasks are hindered. While bigger, you also gain

an asset to tasks that are easier for a larger creature to perform, like climbing, intimidating, wading rivers, and so on. Enabler.

Body Morph (3+ Intellect points): You alter your facial and bodily features and coloration for one hour, hiding your identity or impersonating someone. If you apply a level of Effort, you can imitate a specific person accurately enough to fool someone who knows them well or has observed them closely (including fingerprints and voice prints, but not their retina print or DNA). You have an asset in all tasks involving disguise (this is in addition to the asset from Face Morph). You must apply a separate level of Effort to be able to impersonate a different species (such as a human morphing into a humanoid alien). Action.

 Bolster Illusion (2+ Intellect points): You give one of your visual illusions a limited physical reality that viewers can smell, taste, hear, and feel. This effect is bound to that illusion and acts appropriate to the illusion itself. For example, it can make the illusion of a brick wall feel like brick, the illusion of a person smell like perfume and able to open a door, and the illusion of a fireplace hot to the touch.

The physical reality provided to your illusion is a level 1 effect with 3 health. If the illusion is used to make attacks, it inflicts only 1 point of damage (whether this is regular damage like an illusory punch or kick, or ambient damage like a falling brick wall or a fireplace’s flames). You can increase the level of the created effect by applying levels of Effort to this ability, each level of Effort increasing the effect’s level by 1.

You can activate this ability as part of the action to create an illusion (using whatever ability it is that you use to create illusions, such as Minor Illusion), or use a separate action to apply it to one of your existing illusions. The effect ends if the illusion is destroyed, you let the illusion lapse, the effect’s health is reduced to 0, or ten minutes pass. Enabler.

Boost Manifest Cypher (2 Intellect points): The manifest cypher you activate with your next action functions as if it were 2 levels higher. Action.

Boost Manifest Cypher Function (4 Intellect points): Add 3 to the functioning level of a manifest cypher that you activate with your next action, or change one aspect of its parameters (range, duration, area, etc.) by up to double or down to one tenth. Action.

Charge Weapon (2+ Intellect points): As part of making an attack with your enchanted weapon, you charge it with magical power, inflicting 2 additional points of energy damage. If you make more than one attack on your turn, you choose whether to spend the cost for this ability before you make each attack. Enabler.

Command Beast (3+ Intellect points): You can command a nonhostile, nonhuman beast (such as one that you’ve made calm with Soothe the Savage) of up to level 3 within short range. If you are successful, for the next minute the beast follows your verbal commands to the best of its understanding and ability. The GM has final say over what counts as a nonhuman beast, but unless some kind of deception is at work, you should know whether you can affect a creature before you attempt to use this ability on it. Aliens, extradimensional entities, very intelligent creatures, and robots never count.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to command a level 5 beast (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action to initiate.

Copy Power (2+ Intellect points): You can copy someone else’s superpower

for an hour, performing it as if it were natural for you. Within the past hour you must have touched the creature whose power you want to copy (an attack roll) and must have seen that ability used by them. Choose the power you want to copy, and the GM chooses an appropriate low-tier ability that most closely resembles that power. For example, if you’re battling a supervillain who can create blasts of force, if you copy that ability, you gain a low-tier ability that creates a blast of force.

In addition to the point cost of Copy Power, you must pay the Might, Speed, or Intellect cost (if any) of the equivalent ability that the GM chose. For example, if you want to copy a supervillain’s force blast, the GM will probably decide that’s equivalent to Onslaught (167), so you’d pay 2 Intellect points to activate Copy Power and 1 Intellect point to use Onslaught.

ou can copy only one power at a time; copying another one ends any other power you’re copying with this ability.

Copy Power doesn’t copy effects of a power that permanently adds points to your Pools, such as Enhanced Body (134).

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to copy an ability you saw longer than one hour ago; each level of Effort used in this way extends the time period by one hour. Action.

Defending Weapon: When using your enchanted weapon, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

Defensive Blinking (4 Intellect points): You enter a heightened reactive state so that when you are struck hard enough to take damage, you teleport an immediate distance in a random direction (not up or down) to help evade the brunt of the attack. Your Speed defense rolls are eased for one minute. Action.

Dimensional Squeeze (2+ Intellect points): You cram yourself into a transitional dimension, allowing you to instantaneously appear anywhere you choose within short range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. You can pass through an intervening barrier if it has an open space that you could easily fit your head through—about 1 square foot (30 cm by 30 cm square). In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to pass through a smaller opening in a barrier; each level of Effort used in this way reduces the minimum opening size by one-fourth. You land safely when you use this ability. Action.

> Transitional dimension: A dimension where distances are shorter compared to those in other dimensions, so travel through it is faster than normal movement.

Disguise Other (4+ Intellect points): You apply your shapechanging ability to another creature of your size or smaller, giving them a form that you are able to assume. This lasts for about ten minutes.

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the duration; one level of Effort increases it to an hour, two increases it to a day. A creature can revert to its normal form as an action, but it cannot then change back into the altered form. Action.

You probably can’t use Disguise Other to disguise a kind of creature that is very different from you, such as a human disguising a robot, animal, or crystalline alien

Elastic Grip (3 Might points): Your attack with your stretchy limbs or body is eased. If you hit, you can grab the target, preventing it from moving on its next turn. While you hold the target, its attacks or attempts to break free are hindered. If the target attempts to break free instead of attacking, you must succeed at a Might-based task to maintain your grip. If the target fails to break free, you can continue to hold it each round as your subsequent actions, automatically inflicting 4 points of damage each round by squeezing. Enabler.

Enchanted Movement (4+ Intellect points): You use your enchanted weapon to move yourself to any location within a long distance that you can see, as long as there are no obstacles or barriers in your way. The exact way this happens depends on your weapon; you might throw your magical hammer and be pulled along after it, shoot an arrow from your bow that pulls you forward like a grapple line, and so on. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the distance traveled; each level of Effort used in this way increases the range by another 100 feet (30 m). If you have another ability (such as from your type) that allows you to cross a long distance, the range of that ability and this one increases to very long. Action.

Enchanted Weapon (1 Intellect point): You attune yourself to a physical weapon, such as a sword, hammer, or bow. You know exactly where it is if it is within a short distance of you, and you know its general direction and distance if farther away. All of your other focus abilities require you to be holding or wielding this weapon. You can be attuned to only one weapon at a time; attuning yourself to a second weapon loses the attunement to the first one. Action to initiate; ten minutes to complete. Enabler.

Flex Weapon Skill: At the beginning of each day, choose one type of attack: light bashing, light bladed, light ranged, medium bashing, medium bladed, medium ranged, heavy bashing, heavy bladed, or heavy ranged. For the rest of that day, you are trained in attacks using that type of weapon. You can’t use this ability with an attack skill in which you’re already trained to become specialized. Enabler.

Flight Exertion (3 Might or 3 Speed points): You can fly up to a short distance as your movement this round. If all you do is move on your turn, you can fly up to a long distance. Enabler.

Flying Companion: You gain a level 3 companion creature that can fly at the same speed as you; depending on other aspects of your character, this might be a trained bird, a machine drone, or a helpful strange creature such as a familiar. This creature accompanies you and acts as you direct. As a level 3 companion, it has a target number of 9 and 9 health, and it inflicts 3 points of damage. If it’s killed or destroyed, it takes you one month to find or create a suitable replacement. Enabler. 

Harder Light: When you create an object out of hard light, the object is one level higher than normal. Enabler.

Improved Copying: You can use Copy Power to copy more powerful abilities. In addition to the normal options for using Effort with Copy Power, if you apply one level of Effort, the GM chooses a mid-tier ability that most closely resembles that power (instead of a low-tier ability). Enabler.

When you use Improved Copying, a copied ability must be low, medium, or high tier according to how it is listed in the ability categories. It doesn’t matter if a type or focus makes it available at a lower or higher tier.

Innate Power: Choose either your Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When spending points to activate your focus abilities, you can spend points from this Pool instead of your Intellect Pool (in which case you use your Might Edge or Speed Edge instead of your Intellect Edge, as appropriate). Enabler.

Lend Animal Shape (6+ Intellect points): You change into an animal, and one willing creature within immediate range also transforms into an animal of that type (bear, tiger, wolf, and so on) for ten minutes, as if they were using your Animal Shape ability. For each level of Effort applied,

you can affect one additional creature. All creatures transforming with you must be your size or smaller. A creature can revert to its normal form as an action, but it cannot then change back into the animal form. One creature (whether you or someone else) changing form does not affect any other creature affected with this ability. Action.

A creature that takes animal form with Lend Animal Shape counts as an animal for the use of Animal Scrying

Medium Teleportation (5+ Intellect points): You instantly teleport yourself to any location within a long distance that you can see. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase your range, teleport to a location you can’t see, or bring other people with you. Each additional long distance costs one level of Effort. Teleporting to

a destination you can’t see costs one level of Effort. Each additional one or two targets brought with you costs one level of Effort (you must touch any additional targets). These levels of Effort are counted separately, so teleporting an additional long distance away to a location you can’t see with two passengers costs a total of three levels of Effort. Action.

If you already have Short Teleportation when you select Medium Teleportation or Teleportation, you may replace Short Teleportation with another tier 4 type ability.

Mist Cloud (1+ Intellect points): You create an area of mist an immediate distance across. The cloud lingers for about a minute unless conditions (such as wind or freezing temperatures) dictate otherwise. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the area (one level of Effort to fill a short area, two to fill a long area, or three to fill a very long area). Action.

Modify Cyphers: You can take any two manifest cyphers and quickly jury-rig a new manifest cypher of the same level as the lowest-level cypher. You determine the function of the new cypher, but it must be that of a cypher you have used before (but not necessarily one you’ve ever built). The new cypher is a temperamental cypher, like those created with Always Tinkering. The original two cyphers are consumed in this process. This ability does not function if one or more of the original cyphers are temperamental cyphers. Action.

Multiple Copying: When you use Copy Power, you can copy two of the creature’s abilities at the same time. In addition to the normal options for using Effort with Copy Power, you can apply levels of Effort to copy additional abilities, each level of Effort copying an additional ability beyond the initial two (three for one level of Effort, four for two levels, and so on). Enabler.

Multi-Vanish (4+ Intellect points): You turn up to five human-sized creatures or objects invisible for a short amount of time. The targets you choose must be within an immediate area and within short range of you (if you are in the area, you can make yourself invisible and don’t count toward the limit of five invisible targets). Anything invisible has an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. Affected creatures can see each other in a limited way, and you can see them clearly.

The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn. If one of the affected creatures does something to reveal their presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on—the invisibility ends early for that creature. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the duration; each level of Effort used in this way increases the duration by one round (but creatures can still end it early for themselves). Action.

Power Crash (3+ Intellect points): You strike your enchanted weapon against

the ground (or a similar large surface), creating an explosion of energy that affects an area up to immediate range from that point. (If your enchanted weapon is a ranged weapon, you can instead target a point within close range to be the center of the explosion.) The blast inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or objects within the area (except for you). Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.

Power Memory: When you use Copy Power, you only need to have seen the ability used within the past day (instead of the past hour), and using Effort extends how long ago your copying can reach to one day per level of Effort (instead of one hour per level). Enabler.

Quick Switch: You can activate Shrink as part of another action (the ability is now an enabler for you instead of an action). While the one-minute duration of Shrink is active, on your turn you can change size once before taking an action and once after taking an action. For example, on your turn you could change to small size, make an attack, and then return to your normal size, or you could change to your normal size, use your action to move a short distance, and then return to small size. Enabler.

Short Teleportation (4+ Intellect points): You instantly teleport to any location within a short distance that you can see. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase your range, teleport to a location you can’t see, or bring other people with you. Each additional short distance costs one level of Effort. Teleporting to a destination you can’t see costs one level of Effort. Each additional target brought with you costs one level of Effort (you must touch any additional targets). These levels of Effort are counted separately, so teleporting an additional short distance away to a location you can’t see with one passenger costs a total of three levels of Effort. Action.

> If you already have Short Teleportation when you select Medium Teleportation or Teleportation, you may replace Short Teleportation with another tier 4 type ability.

Shrink (1+ Might points): You (and your clothing or suit) become much smaller than your normal size. You become 6 inches (15 cm) tall and stay that way for about a minute. During this time, you add 4 points to your Speed Pool and add +2 to your Speed Edge. While you are smaller than normal, your Speed defense rolls are eased, your movement speed is one-tenth normal, and your attacks inflict half the normal amount of damage (divide the total damage in half after all bonuses, Effort, and other damage modifiers). You can return to your normal size as part of another action.

When the effects of Shrink end, your Speed Edge, movement speed, and damage return to normal, and you subtract a number of points from your Speed Pool equal to the number you gained (if this brings the Pool to 0, subtract the overflow first from your Might Pool and then, if necessary, from your Intellect Pool). Each additional time you use Shrink before your next ten-hour recovery roll, you must apply an additional level of Effort (one level of Effort for the second use, two levels of Effort for the third use, and so on).

Action to initiate.

> The increased Effort cost for repeat uses of Shrink between ten-hour recovery rolls only applies to new activations of Shrink, not to multiple size changes within one use of Shrink enabled by Quick Switch.

Shrink Others: You can use Shrink on other willing creatures within an immediate distance. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Unless these creatures have an ability to change their size, they remain small until the one-minute duration of Shrink ends for them. Enabler.

Small Flight (3+ Intellect points): For the next hour, when using Shrink, you can fly through the air. You might accomplish this flight by growing wings from your body, extending wings from your suit, calling a tiny creature to carry you, or “surfing” air currents. When flying, you can move up to a short distance as part of another action or a long distance if all you do on your turn is move. Action to initiate.

Smaller: When you use Shrink, you can choose to shrink down to about half an inch (1 cm) high, and you add 3 more temporary points to your Speed Pool. Enabler.

Steal Power: When you use Copy Power to copy an ability, the creature you copied it from loses access to that ability for about a minute. While you have their ability, any attempt by the creature to use their ability requires them to succeed at a task (Might, Speed, or Intellect, as appropriate to the stolen ability) opposed by your eased Intellect task. If they succeed, they regain the use of their ability and you lose it. Enabler.

If you want to make it more difficult for someone to take back their stolen power, become skilled in the Steal Power ability, or put a power shift in power for it.

Teleportation Burst (3 Intellect points): You rapidly teleport multiple times in an immediate area, confusing your opponents and allowing you to make an additional melee attack this round. You can use this ability once per round. Enabler.

Teleportive Wound (7+ Intellect points): You touch a creature and, if your attack succeeds, you teleport away (up to your normal maximum teleportation distance) with a significant portion of their body. If the target is level 2 or lower, it dies. If the target is level 3 or higher, it takes 6 points of damage and is stunned on its next action. If the target is a PC of any tier, they move down one step on the damage track. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect a more powerful target (one level of Effort means a target of up to level 3 dies or a target of level 4 or higher takes damage and is stunned, and so on). Action.

Temporary Light (2 Intellect points): You create an object of solid light in any shape you can imagine that is your size or smaller, and it persists for about a minute (or longer, if you concentrate on it after that time). The object appears in an area adjacent to you, but afterward you can move it up to a short distance each round as part of another action. It is crude and can have no moving parts, so you can make a sword, a shield, a short ladder,

and so on. The object has the approximate mass of the real object and is level 2. Action.

Throw Enchanted Weapon: You can throw your enchanted weapon up to short range as a light ranged weapon. Whether it hits or misses, it immediately flies back to your hands, and you can automatically catch it or allow it to land at your feet. Enabler.

Tiny: When you use Shrink, you can choose to shrink down to about one-sixteenth of an inch (.2 cm). When you do, you add 5 more temporary points to your Speed Pool (plus any from Smaller), and because your attacks are concentrated into a very small area, you deal an additional 2 points of damage. For each level of Effort you apply to shrink even more, you become one-tenth as tall (one one-hundredth for two levels of Effort, one one-thousandth for three, and so on) and you add 1 more point to your Speed Pool. Enabler.

In campaigns where characters can travel to parallel dimensions, using Tiny to shrink to

one-thousandth of your normal height may be a means of doing so.

War Flesh: You can instantly transform your hands and feet into claws, and your human teeth into fangs, or revert to your normal human appearance. When you make attacks with your claws or fangs, they count as medium weapons instead of light weapons. Enabler.

Wildcard Powers: You have a gift with using copied powers in unusual ways. Whenever you try a power stunt and use a level of Effort on the special roll to modify the ability, you get a free level of Effort on that roll. Enabler.

Wing Weapons: You can use your wings to make melee attacks (even when flying), leaving your hands and feet free. Your wings are medium bashing or bladed weapons (your choice). You are practiced with this attack. Enabler.

The archetypes suggest how to assign your power shifts. This is an important aspect of designing your hero because power shifts are what make your characters exceptional in a “supers” way. Superheroes are known for being faster, tougher, stronger, or smarter than regular people, and that sort of comparison isn’t always part of the abilities you get from your type or focus. A regular person might be very skilled at martial arts, but a superhero martial artist might punch through an iron door, dodge a burst of bullets from a machine gun at close range, or quickly recover from a mortal wound, all thanks to power shifts. This part of each archetype writeup assumes your hero starts with five power shifts, but most archetype descriptions give only two or three suggestions, allowing you some flexibility to customize your superhero. For example, a master athlete with two power shifts in healing is a very different character than one with two power shifts in resilience.

> In some cases, you might need to tinker with the aesthetics of the abilities described in the character options to make them fit your character. 

## POWER SOURCE  
As you’re figuring out what type, descriptor, focus, and power shifts you want for

your character, think about how you got your powers. Are you a mutant, born with special abilities? Do you have a high-tech costume with built-in nanotechnology? Are you a sorcerer, or maybe a psychic? The source of your powers is character flavor—for example, there’s no game mechanics difference between the mental powers of an alien member of a telepathic species, a human character who built a brain-augmenting helmet, or a faerie character from the starlight dimension who knows mind-magic. All three of those characters could have the same type, focus, descriptor, and power shifts, but they’d be very different people and have very different reasons for being a part of the RPG campaign.

If you can’t decide how you got your powers, or if you like leaving some things up to chance, try rolling once or twice on the Power Origin table and pick the result that you like better, or combine the two into something weird and unique.

Remember that you can permanently increase the range of one of your abilities with the increased range power shift.

STARTING JUST PAST TIER 1

An interesting option for a GM starting a superhero campaign is to immediately give each PC 4 XP, which they must spend on a special advancement option to gain another type ability. It’s another way (along with power shifts) to make new superhero PCs feel a cut above player characters in other genres—and gives players a little more wiggle room in building the character they want to play.

## RANDOM SUPERPOWERS

The following table has a broad selection of powers (or in some cases, sets of related powers). Players who are stuck for ideas about their superhero can roll once or twice on the table for inspiration; use the Example column for a suggested game example of that kind of power, whether that’s a power shift, a hero archetype, a focus, or a specific special ability (of course, these suggestions aren’t the only way to achieve that power).

The GM can also use this table to come up with random abilities for supervillains. However, there is much more leeway in designing NPC abilities, so the Example column is more for suggesting game mechanics than abilities to choose.

## FAIRYTALE CHARACTER OPTIONS

FORM VS. FUNCTION

In a fairy tale game, the PCs might consist of a talking fox, an ogre, a fairy, and a human the size of your thumb. And that’s perfectly fine. Build your character sentence in a way that plays to your character’s strengths and weaknesses, and the rest can be handled through story and narrative. Playing a talking bear, a gingerbread

man, or a changeling will likely affect your character’s appearance, their outlook on life, and their backstory, but it doesn’t necessarily affect their abilities, skills, and Pools beyond what you choose during character creation.

Because the form that you choose doesn’t typically offer you something in addition to your Cypher System stats—being small, for example, does not inherently mean you’re stealthy—you’ll want to choose your stats to emphasize the bit of your character that you want to play.

## SKILLS

As described in the Cypher System Rulebook, there is no definitive list of skills. Characters can choose to become skilled in anything they like (with the GM’s permission). In addition to the suggested skills in the rulebook, useful skills for fairy tale games might include: 

• Talking animals\*

• Talking nature\*

• Trickery

• Using magic 

• Weather

• Baking

• Cobbling 

• Curses

• Dancing 

• Death

• Magic

• Playing an instrument 

• Puzzles

• Riddles

• Sailing

• Sensing magic 

• Singing

Remember that only skills gained through character type abilities or in other rare instances allow you to become skilled with attack or defense tasks. Thus, all magic skills are noncombat skills only.

\* These skills could be used in a number of different ways, depending on the setting. If the setting has talking animals that the players can’t understand, the talking animals skill could help a PC communicate with them in other ways. If there are talking animals that the characters can understand, the skill could provide an asset in social interactions.

## TYPE

Your character’s type is the core of who they are and how they interact with their environment, their companions, and other living creatures they encounter.

## FOCUS

Heartwood Foci

• Befriends the Black Dog 

• Curses the World

• Feigns No Fear

• Lived Among the Fey

Adjusted Foci

Battles Robots, Builds Robots, Talks to Machines

Best for settings that include elements of science fiction. Alternatively, “robots” can be a stand-in for puppets, steampunk entities, golems, or other creations such as Pinocchio, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man. Mister Geppetto would likely be someone who Builds Robots, while Muska (from Miyazaki’s film Laputa: Castle in the Sky) might be someone who Battles Robots.

Drives Like a Maniac

Best for modern settings or those where traditional fairy tale vehicles such as horse-drawn carriages, magic carpets, witch’s brooms, and chicken-legged huts are common.

Fuses Flesh and Steel, Fuses Mind and Machine

Best for steampunk or weird science mashups. Edward Scissorhands and the Tin Man are probably characters who Fuse Flesh and Steel. Alternatively, renaming the foci to Fuses Flesh and Magic or Wants to Become a Real Boy can provide characters with the same benefits from a more magical-sounding source.

Is Licensed to Carry

With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for someone who wants to wield a wand, bow, or other ranged weapon. 

Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger

With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for someone who used to be a sailor or pirate.

## FAIRY TALE CHARACTER ARCS

Character arcs are fantastic opportunities for players to deepen their roleplaying options, add to the narrative, and set goals that can intertwine with and strengthen a campaign or adventure. While character arcs aren’t a requirement, they work particularly well in fairy tale games, where individual goals and tasks are often at the forefront of what drives adventures.

Players can pick from any of the sample character arcs in the Cypher System Rulebook, make up their own (with the assistance and approval of the GM), or choose one of the new character arcs created specifically for the Heartwood setting.

## POST-APOCALYPTIC CHARACTER OPTIONS

Alternate Character Roles

Characters who play out the apocalypse itself or who have just survived it and must pick up a few hours, days, or months after the end should choose from an alternate slate of roles. If you begin your game in such a setting, it makes much more sense to let your players choose roles for characters in a modern game.

## DESCRIPTORS

In addition to the descriptors in the Cypher System Rulebook, you can widen the options

available to the players, allowing them to choose from the descriptors presented here for

their characters. A subset of the descriptors in this chapter are species descriptors, which

may or may not be appropriate for your players, depending on your setting.

Rust and Redemption Descriptors

Standard: Bitter, Hopeful, Rusted, Shiny

Species: Canien, Felis, Flutter, Mutant

Bitter

Someone you cared for wronged you. They may have done so directly by betraying a trust, stealing your supplies, or giving you up to raiders to save their own life. Maybe they did it indirectly by going missing or dying on you. Or maybe it was an organization or institution that let you down. Whatever it was, you’ve spent a lot of time pulled into yourself, paranoid and mistrustful of others. But something’s happened lately that has at least opened you to the possibility of trusting others again. Maybe you have to work with someone else or die. Alternatively, perhaps you’ve decided to try one more time, despite your disillusionment. It’s either that or fully give in to bitterness.

You gain the following characteristics:

Skeptical: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re always wondering who’s going to wrong you next. You are trained in detecting deception.

Skill: You are trained in tracking creatures. If a creature has wronged you, the tracking task is eased.

Inability: You have a hard time not letting bitterness stain everything you do. Interaction tasks are hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a keepsake from whoever wronged you. It could be an object they once possessed, a picture of them, or something else you associate with what makes you so bitter.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You found the other PCs in a situation they couldn’t survive. Uncharacteristically, you helped them.

2\. You were facing certain death, but the PCs saved you, for no reason other than they saw your need.

3\. You want to change your ways, and the PCs seem to offer a chance for you to explore that possibility.

4\. You have no idea how you joined the PCs. You’re just going along with it for now until answers present themselves.

Canien

You’re an evolved, intelligent dog with the ability to speak and use tools. Some caniens stand upright and have hands, and others are quadrupeds who can use a combination of their front paws and mouth as adroitly as a handed canien; you decide which kind of canien you are. Most canien clothing and equipment accommodates walking on either two feet or four, so that’s normally not an issue. Either way, you’ve got fur, a tail, and a noble dog visage true to your particular line of descent. And like most caniens, you’re loyal to your pack and friends. But you may find strangers a little suspicious, in which case you aren’t shy about letting them know. However, you’re usually willing to entertain the idea that a newcomer may be a friend you just don’t know yet.

You gain the following characteristics:

Dogged: +2 to your Might Pool.

Skill: You are naturally vigilant. You are trained in perception tasks.

Skill: You are playful. You are trained in tasks involving playing physical games.

Loyal: If an ally within immediate range descends one or more steps on the damage

track, you can take an action immediately but in a restricted fashion. You can use this action either to move the willing ally up to an immediate distance or to attempt a healing task on your ally.

Bite: You are practiced in making unarmed bite attacks (light weapon). Enabler.

Chewer: You are something of an oral fidgeter, like most caniens. After each ten-hour recovery roll, make a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll. If you fail, you discover you’ve unconsciously been chewing on a piece of your equipment; it’s ruined, at least until it is repaired.

Inability: You have a hard time seeing disloyalty in others. Tasks that involve detecting falsehoods are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first

adventure.

1\. One of the other PCs needed help, and you obliged without a second’s hesitation.

2\. The other PCs were going somewhere, and you came along even though they didn’t ask you to.

3\. Aggression got the better of you, and now you’re running from the fallout of that experience.

4\. You feel that one of the other PCs is in danger in some way, and you’d like to help

out or keep an eye on them.

Felis

You’re an evolved, intelligent cat with the ability to speak and use tools. Felis are equally comfortable running on all fours or standing around in a clowder of other felis gossiping over catswort tea. Your fur is your protection from the elements, but you sometimes wear a harness for your equipment and may adopt boots for rough terrain and hats for fashion or function. Your visage is like that of before-times cats, including piercing, reflective eyes. Like other felis, you are crafty and cautious, unless you feel comfortable with others, in which case you can laze away hours in the sun or a warm spot. But if need be, you are quick to act and are not afraid to use your claws to defend yourself.

You gain the following characteristics:

Crafty: +2 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: You’re innately curious. You are trained in tasks involving knowledge, figuring out problems, or solving puzzles.

Skill: You are agile. You are trained in tasks involving balancing and movement.

Darksight: You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.

Claws: You are practiced in making unarmed claw attacks (light weapon). Enabler.

Light on Your Paws: You ignore the first 4 points of damage you would otherwise suffer from a fall. Enabler.

Jumpy: Like most felis, you are a bit high-strung. Anytime another creature acts with surprise against you, make a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll. If you fail, the first action you take on your turn is to flee using your full movement away from whoever surprised you.

Inability: You often come across as aloof. Tasks that involve positive social interaction are hindered.

Inability: You sometimes get lost in new locations you haven’t visited before. You have an inability in navigation.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Everything was fine until you were attacked by a raiding band of “cat-skinners.” The PCs helped you fight back or flee.

2\. You saw the PCs up to something, and your curiosity got the better of you, so you followed them.

3\. One of the other PCs invited you to join after they saw you scheme, plot, or solve a difficult problem.

4\. You got lost. The PCs found you and invited you to join their group.

Flutter

You emerged from the chrysalis with your mind awash in skills instilled while you matured, as well as knowledge handed down from your ancestors. If the stories are true, some of your knowledge comes from even further back, ceded by godlike “humans” who raised flutters into the light of self-knowledge. That was before humans were lost, leaving the world in ruins. Ruins that are now yours to refurbish and rebuild or, as many prefer, to ignore while you instead go your own way. Humans may have created you, but they’re gone, and you can decide what you think you owe them, if anything.

As a flutter, you are kin to the much smaller natural moths that still flit by night. But you have an internal skeleton and lungs, and are far larger. For all that, you also have wings, a proboscis, and much thinner limbs than the average animal still roaming the world.

You gain the following characteristics:

Quick: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You are adept at using your body’s natural patterns of camouflage. You are trained in hiding.

Darksight: You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and can see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.

Fragile: When you fail a Might defense roll to avoid damage, you take 1 extra point of damage.

Inability: You are confused by bright light. Perception tasks are hindered in bright light.

Erratic Flyer: You can select Hover as if it were on your type’s list of tier 1 abilities. Your ability to move as described in Hover is due to your wings. In addition to the base ability described for Hover, if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect roll, you can keep your position in the air instead of drifting with the wind or allowing momentum to move you.

On a failure, you fly erratically as your action, possibly into the ground, a wall, or the midst of enemies you were trying to avoid. Enabler.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. Some piece of knowledge gleaned from your time in the chrysalis made you seek out and join the PCs.

2\. The ruins are where knowledge of humans exists, and you heard the PCs were headed there.

3\. You overheard the PCs talking about a grand adventure, and you wanted to be part of it.

4\. You zigged when you should have zagged and ran headlong into the PCs. They patched you up and you stayed with them.

Hopeful

Despite civilization’s fall, you’re optimistic about what the future could bring, confident

that it will be bright. In fact, now that all the old institutions and cares of the world are gone, you hope something better can be rebuilt in its place. It’s possible that you’re bubbly and full of cheer. But you might instead be quietly confident, your hope revealed by the way you always try again if at first you fail. Being hopeful doesn’t mean you’re blind to others’ faults, but you can hope they will do better next time, which might lead you to be more forgiving than other survivors. After all, when you screw up, you hope others will allow you the same luxury of learning from your mistakes.

You gain the following characteristics:

Spirited: +4 to your Intellect Pool.

Skill: Mental malaise doesn’t affect you like it does others. You are trained in Intellect defense tasks.

Shrug Off Disappointment: When you fail at a noncombat task and try that task again the very next round, you can apply a free level of Effort toward the success of that task. This benefit effectively alleviates the requirement to apply a level of Effort when retrying failed tasks, at least the first time you retry. Enabler.

Inability: You have a lightness of being, but you really feel it when you’re physically challenged. Might defense tasks are hindered.

Inability: You’re spirited but not fast. All movement-related tasks are hindered.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The PCs were in a bad spot, and one of the other PCs asked you along to add some perspective.

2\. You had a spot of bad luck, but you jumped back in to try something new, hopeful it would work out.

3\. To make good on a promise to help, you came with the other PCs.

4\. You answered a cry for help when another PC got in over their head.

Mutant

Savage forces strong enough to destroy a world left you transformed. Either through latent mutations passed down from ancestors that survived the apocalypse, or because something about you reacts when you’re exposed to radiation or some other mutagenic source, you are prone to mutation. You might look relatively similar to others of your species, or you might have one or more obvious physical differences that make it hard to disguise your nature. Not that you necessarily want to hide what you are; you might wish to proudly display what makes you different and, to your mind, better.

You gain the following characteristics:

Significant Mutations: Choose which option from the following list you’d like for your mutations. Whichever you choose, it is rolled for randomly; you don’t select it.

• Two beneficial mutations rolled randomly.

• Three beneficial mutations plus one harmful mutation, all rolled randomly

• One powerful mutation and one harmful mutation, both rolled randomly.

• One beneficial mutation, one distinctive mutation, and one harmful mutation, all rolled randomly.

Distinctive Mutations: You can choose if you want to have distinctive mutations or not. If you do, choose the number, up to four distinctive mutations, which are rolled for randomly. (If the GM is using the transitory mutations optional rule, you can only choose to have up to three distinctive mutations.)

Cosmetic Mutations: You can choose if you want to have cosmetic mutations or not. If you do, choose whether you want one or two cosmetic mutations, which are rolled for randomly. Once all your mutations have been rolled for, work together with the GM to ensure that what’s been rolled is a character you want to play.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. The other PCs found you in some weird “mutant” chrysalis and pulled you out; you were grateful and joined them.

2\. The other PCs were “hunting mutants” but when they found you, they realized they had been misguided.

3\. You wanted to get away from a bad situation, so you went with the PCs.

4\. The PCs asked you to come along, believing that your particular mutations could be harnessed for the benefit of the mission.

Rusted

Life has dealt you some hard knocks. You lost an eye, an arm, or a leg several years ago, possibly during the apocalypse itself, or perhaps afterward. But you didn’t give up. You adjusted, learning to do everything again, despite what first seemed like a limitation. If you lost a limb, you use a prosthetic; if an eye, you sometimes quip that binocular vision is overrated. Sure, there are times when you struggle with discomfort, pain, and possibly even self-consciousness. However, overcoming all that only makes you stronger and more determined to succeed. Ultimately, your scars, your prosthetic (if any), and your story represent who you are: a survivor who overcomes whatever is thrown your way.

You gain the following characteristics:

Resilient: +2 to your Might Pool or +2 to your Intellect Pool or +1 to all three Pools.

Skill: Hard knocks have toughened you; you are trained in either Might defense tasks or Intellect defense tasks (choose one).

Skill: You had to fake it until you made it; you are trained in one creative skill such as singing, writing, acting, composing, public speaking, painting, sculpture, dancing, or something similar.

Inability: You’ve learned to do everything again and, in truth, better than most people ever could. But your injury is real; it’s why you sometimes joke that you’re “rusted.” If you’ve lost an eye, your perception tasks involving sight are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic leg, tasks requiring movement are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic arm, tasks involving using both hands are hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a prosthetic for one arm or one leg, or you have an eyepatch (and prosthetic eye) for a missing eye.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

1\. You bragged that there’s nothing someone else could do that you couldn’t do twice as well, which is how you got involved in your current situation.

2\. You’re afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.

3\. You were tailing one of the other PCs for reasons of your own, which brought you into the action.

4\. You stepped in to defend one of the PCs when that character was threatened. While talking to them afterward, you heard about the group’s task.

Shiny

You’re brash and bright, and you exult in situations, people, and objects that seem to you as if they have a similar sheen. Literally shiny objects qualify, as well as objects that are not rusted or degraded by time’s passage or the effects of the apocalypse. You also tend to fall into the orbit of people who are strong, unbeaten, and possessed of an inner brightness. You believe that they, like you, reflect the light of some greater spiritual purpose in the world. When you believe you are acting in that glow, you are emboldened and may take risks others fear. You don’t seek death, but you’re confident that death in the pursuit of something shiny is the definition of a life well-lived.

You gain the following characteristics:

Lithe: +2 to your Speed Pool.

Skill: You’ve had practice driving a before-times vehicle. Choose a motorcycle, car or truck, or long-haul truck; you’re trained in driving that kind of vehicle.

Skill: You know how to get out of the way. You are trained in Speed defense tasks.

Shiny Maneuver: You know how to push yourself harder, at the risk of a more dramatic failure. When you attempt a shiny maneuver, you ease a task, attack roll, or defense roll, but in doing so you increase the intrusion range by two for that roll, to a 1–3 on a d20. If you fail and decide to retry the task (requiring that you spend a level of Effort, as normal), it has the same increased intrusion range. Once you attempt a shiny maneuver, you can’t attempt another until you make a recovery roll. Enabler.

Inability: You may be lithe and shiny, but you’re not sneaky. Tasks related to sneaking and staying quiet are hindered.

Inability: You are irrepressible, but that makes it hard to dissemble. Deception and disguise tasks are hindered.

Additional Equipment: You have a treasured object that is literally shiny in bright light, such as a polished stainless-steel sphere, a silver coin, a pocket watch from the before-times, or something else small and easily carried.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:

From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. It seemed like there were equal odds that the other PCs wouldn’t succeed, which sounded good to you.

2\. The first word that popped into your head upon seeing the PCs was “shiny.”

3\. You think the tasks ahead will present you with unique and fulfilling challenges.

4\. Someone you trust and respect above all others suggested you join the PCs to help them complete their task.

The Scavenges focus can be used as written in the Cypher System Rulebook, but whenever the abilities point to the scavenging rules and tables from the rulebook (including Ruin Lore, Junkmonger, Know Where to Look, and other abilities), use the optional rule for scavenging, repairing, and building in this book instead.

## FOCI

This section presents new post-apocalyptic foci that can be used as-is in most games set after civilization falls. As these were created specifically for the post-apocalyptic genre, each has an expanded description with more story details than the foci in the Cypher System Rulebook (which have short, broad descriptions suitable for other genres).

Merges Mind With Machine

You were raised in an underground bunker by Milly, an AI instance installed in your

brain before you developed cognition of your own. Unlike AI zombies, your personality and motivations haven’t been replaced; your sense of self grew alongside the AI, as collaborators rather than foes. This granted you superior intellect and an uncanny knack for computers. Now you’ve emerged into the larger world, where survivors are predisposed to distrust you, and you may need to keep your background a secret to be accepted. Whether you hate AI or remain loyal to Milly, you face the best odds if you can fit in with another group of survivors. After all, there’s a lot you don’t know about how things work on the surface and the things people have done to stay alive in the past twenty years.

Connection: Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections

in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1\. Pick one other PC. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities, and that it might lead to problems.

2\. Pick one other PC. You’re not sure how or from where, but that character has access to rare machine parts and can get them for you at half price.

3\. Pick one other PC. Seeing you use your focus abilities triggers unpleasant memories for that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.

4\. Pick one other PC. They are sensitive to your focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazed for a few rounds, hindering their actions.

Additional Equipment: You have scars on your scalp in the shape of circuitry (like Lichtenberg figures). You probably keep these hidden, as they identify you as one of Milly’s children to anyone familiar with the mark.

Minor Effect Suggestion: You restore 2 points to your Intellect Pool.

Major Effect Suggestion: An ally or indicated target can take an additional action.

Tier 1:

Interface

Tier 2:

Robot Assistant

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Assisted Sight or Machine Telepathy as your tier 4 ability.

Assisted Sight (3 Intellect points): You can activate a visual overlay that helps you analyze threats and boons in your environment. When you trigger this ability, you gain an asset on one attack or defense roll of any type, due to your knowledge about the situation. Enabler.

Machine Telepathy

Tier 4:

Machine Bond

Network Tap

Tier 5:

Greater Enhanced Intellect

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Master Machine or See the Future as your tier 6 ability.

Master Machine  
See the Future

Merges Mind With Machine is a focus designed for use with the Radio Quiet setting.

Prepped for the End

You prepared for ultimate disaster, unlike most of the sheeple. Which means you stashed away food, water, and other survival gear when things were still okay. You trained yourself for harsh conditions, for basic machine and electronic repair, and maybe even in a musical instrument to pass the time in the bunker when no other entertainments could be had. You’d excel in a small group of other survivors, but you’re ready to go it alone if that’s what it

takes. Above all, you’re prepared to make it through whatever the future holds, no matter how daunting the odds. Because you prepped wisely.

Connection: Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1\. Pick one other PC. You found them in your prepped hideout, eating and drinking their fill. You befriended them rather than seeking revenge for using your resources.

2\. Pick one other PC. You used to play card games with them before the apocalypse, and you still owe them money, though what that means now is difficult to say.

3\. Pick one other PC. This character doesn’t seem to want any of your stored food or water.

4\. Pick one other PC. When you were hurt, they carried you to your prepped hideout at great risk to themselves.

Additional Equipment: A firearm of your choice (with ten bullets or shells), a handloading tool set, and a small musical instrument (such as a harmonica).

Minor Effect Suggestion: Your foe slips in some decaying garbage or spill from the before‑times, and their actions in the next round are hindered as they regain their balance.

Major Effect Suggestion: You find or spy an item from the Useful Stuff table.

Tier 1:P

Practiced in Light Armor: You can wear light armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing light armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing light armor by 1. You start the game with a type of light armor available in the area, such as a leather jacket. Enabler.

Prepared Caches: You have a prepped secret hideout with shelter and basic supplies capable of seeing you through a year or more, or up to six people through about three months. In addition, you have knowledge of three different secret supply caches you put together and hid before everything fell apart, chosen from the following. The caches are located no closer than about 5 miles (8 km) from each other.

• Food cache (enough food for six people for twelve weeks)

• Water cache (enough clean water for six people for twelve weeks)

• Ammunition cache (400 shells or bullets for four different weapons)

• Firearm cache (six firearms; a mix of light, medium, and heavy weapons, each usually found with about ten bullets or shells)

Enabler.

Trained for Toughing It: Choose one noncombat skill that would be helpful for surviving after the apocalypse, such as hunting, tracking, carpentry, or stealth. You are trained in that skill. Enabler.

Tier 2:

Tinker

Weather the Vicissitudes

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Fruitfully Pass the Time or Stashed Vehicle as your tier 3 ability.

Fruitfully Pass the Time (4 Intellect points): You are trained in one performance skill, such as singing; playing a fiddle, harmonica, or other instrument; or something else that others would enjoy watching or hearing you do. When you perform with the skill gained through this ability for one minute and you succeed on a difficulty 3 performance roll, you and all allies within short range who can hear and see you immediately gain a one‑action recovery roll. You can’t use this on someone again until you use a one‑hour or ten‑hour recovery roll. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.

Stashed Vehicle: You track down where you or a fellow prepper stashed a vehicle, pristinely stored to remain in working order with minimal repairs required. The vehicle has a viable power source (such as hundreds of gallons of gasoline treated to resist decomposition, or a rechargeable battery with options for solar or wind recharging). The vehicle could be an all‑terrain vehicle (ATV), a truck, or something else; work with your GM to figure out the particulars. Enabler

Tier 4:

Know Where to Look: Whenever the GM obtains a result for you on the Useful Stuff table, you get two results instead of one. If the GM is using some other method to generate rewards for finding valuables, you gain double the result you would otherwise obtain. Enabler.

Tier 5:

Ambusher

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Discipline of Watchfulness or Escape the Ruins as your tier 6 ability.

Discipline of Watchfulness

Escape the Ruins (6 Intellect points): While in any area containing ruins from before the apocalypse, you find or create a significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an Intellect action whose difficulty is set by the GM based on the situation. You and the GM should work out the details. Action.

Raids

When civilization fell, you did what you had to do to stay alive. Did you kill innocent people? Probably, insofar as anyone who survived the end can really be considered “innocent.” You figured they’d have done the same to you. But whether they deserved it or not, you and the other raiders you ran with survived, and your targets did not. Then something life‑changing happened to you, altering your perspective; it’s up to you to decide what. In any case, you’ve turned over a new leaf. You don’t indiscriminately kill anymore, though surviving is still a goal. But you’ve joined with others who you want to protect as much as or even more than your own life. You’re done with raiding. But is raiding (and those who might recognize you as a raider) done with you?

Connection: Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1\. Pick one other PC. That character knows that you were a raider, even though it is a secret you’ve kept from the other PCs so far.

2\. Pick one other PC. They were also a raider, however briefly, along with you (if they agree to this connection).

3\. Pick one other PC. You feel very protective of this character and don’t want to see them harmed.

4\. Pick one other PC. You know that you’re responsible for the death of someone that character knew while you were raiding; they don’t know it, but the guilt has been waking you up in the middle of the night.

Additional Equipment: You have a tattoo from your raiding days that you probably keep hidden, as it would identify you as a raider to those familiar with the mark.

Minor Effect Suggestion: You restore 2 points to your Might Pool.

Major Effect Suggestion: You or an ally get an immediate extra attack.

Tier 1:

Ignore the Pain

Wilderness Life

Tier 2:

Careful Tracker: You are trained in stealth and tracking tasks. Enabler.

Fearsome Reputation

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Raider Follower or Grand Deception as your tier 3 ability.

Raider Follower: You gain a level 3 follower (initiative, stealth, and defense as level 4). The follower does as you say and, generally speaking, isn’t someone who makes the other PCs in your group feel uncomfortable because of their

presence. Enabler.

Grand Deception

Tier 4:

Greater Frenzy

Tier 5:

Using the Environment

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Deep Consideration or Twisting the Knife as your tier 6 ability.

Deep Consideration

Twisting the Knife

Remembers the Past

You are a student of the before‑times. Maybe that’s because you grew up in the ruins of an old library and read everything as your hobby, you found a friendly AI archivist who taught you about how things once were, you’re long‑lived and were alive before the apocalypse, or you have a deep recollection of the world before the end for some other reason. This knowledge gives you an appreciation of the before‑times as well as a point of view that many other survivors lack that benefits you in and around ruins. You can find things others wouldn’t know to look for, plucking fruits of the past that would otherwise go unharvested.

Connection: Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1\. Pick one other PC. They remind you of someone you knew or learned about from the past, because of either the way they look or the way they act, and that is what first drew you to them.

2\. Pick one other PC. You saved their life because you found them trapped in a before‑times ruin and you knew how best to free them.

3\. Pick one other PC. You were lost out past the ruins in the wilderness, but they happened across you and saved your life.

4\. Pick one other PC. This character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children.

Additional Equipment: One book on a technical topic such as plumbing, carpentry, electronics, or physics; it provides you an asset on a related task if you spend ten minutes perusing the book ahead of time.

Minor Effect Suggestion: You remember something about the area that proves advantageous later, such as realizing there’s probably a fresh location to scavenge close by that has a good chance of not having been picked over by other survivors.

Major Effect Suggestion: A foe forgets about you unless you draw attention to yourself.

Tier 1:

Ruin Lore: You are trained in scavenging, which means you’re more likely to find useful things (and junk that can potentially be turned into useful things) in the ruins of what came before. Enabler.

Knowledge Skills

Tier 2:

Fixer: You’ve learned enough of the past that you are trained in tasks to repair and build before‑times equipment, or equipment made with before‑times parts. In addition, repairing and building tasks take you about 20% less time to complete. Enabler.

Know the Way: You are familiar with before‑times buildings and other structures, which extends to ruins of the same. You are trained in tasks related to getting around inside those buildings quickly, finding alternate routes, finding places to hide, and other tasks associated with gaining a benefit by being able to picture a likely floor plan of any given building. Enabler.

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Disable Mechanisms or Resource Seeker as your tier 3 ability. Disable Mechanisms

Resource Seeker (3+ Intellect points): When you are looking for a specific inexpensive item you’d like to scavenge from nearby ruins, such as a candle, an aspirin, or a can of preserved chili, you can focus your attention on it so that you are more likely to find it. For the next ten minutes, if what you are seeking is within long range, you find it if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect roll. Each time you use this ability again in the same area, the difficulty is hindered by one additional step. For each level of Effort you apply, you can attempt to find an object of one higher expense category, but the base difficulty of the Intellect roll also increases by 1 per higher expense category. Action to initiate.

Tier 4:

Improvise

Tier 5:

Task Specialization

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Skill With Attacks, Skill With Defense, or Use the Network as your tier 6 ability.

Skill With Attacks

Skill With Defense

Use the Network (5 Intellect points): With a few minutes of looking around and preparing, you can access remnants of the before‑times internet and satellite network (or an active network on which AIs who are not immediately dangerous reside). The GM may decide there is no such connection in the area, but if there is, you can ask one basic question about anything happening within 10 miles (16 km) and receive a simple answer. For example, you could ask about the location of a specific creature or individual, and if they are within the range of this ability, you’ll learn about it from a still‑functioning camera feed, satellite feed, or AI interaction. Action to initiate.

Walks the Wasteland

Most people want to hide from the devastation or just curl up and die rather than face a hostile world. Not you. You’re determined to see what’s out there, to survive, and, more than that, to thrive. It’s that or let the radioactive rats—or whatever it is that hunts the ruins—get you. If you were around before the end, you could have been a soldier, mercenary, or at least someone who had basic survival training. What sets you apart from all the others like you is that you decided to hope when everything looked darkest. Since then, you have eaten your share of spoiled food and irradiated water, and survived. Whether that’s because you’ve adapted, you’re luckier, or you were just tougher than the rest is anyone’s guess. But you’re still walking the wastes even though so many others are gone. You probably don’t spend a lot of time on your appearance, given that you wear the cobbled‑together clothing and bits and pieces of armor you’re able to scavenge from the ruins. Appearance doesn’t matter; actions do.

Connection: Choose one of the following, or choose one of the Focus Connections in the Cypher System Rulebook.

1\. Pick one other PC. This character appears to be an able survivor, but in your mind, they seem to be at the end of their rope. You’re constantly trying to convince them to keep trying, go the distance, and survive for a better tomorrow.

2\. Pick one other PC. You feel very protective of this character and don’t want to see them harmed.

3\. Pick one other PC. This character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children. Whether that place exists any longer is something you and that character should decide.

4\. Pick one other PC. You found this character almost dead in the wastes. You rescued them, nursed them back to health, and kept them safe until they were back on their feet. Whether they feel embarrassment, gratitude, or something else is up to them.

Additional Equipment: You have a piece of before‑times equipment with three analog dials that measure temperature, air pressure, and humidity. (You also know the names for the instruments nestled behind

those dials: a thermometer, a barometer, and a hygrometer, respectively.) If you spend a minute operating the device, you have an asset on weather prediction tasks extending into the next day.

Minor Effect Suggestion: You restore 2 points to your Might Pool.

Major Effect Suggestion: Your next action is eased by two steps.

Tier 1:

Surviving the Wasteland: Given about half a day of walking and scavenging, you find enough edible food and potable water in the ruins or surrounding wasteland for you and up to one other person for one day. The resources might be scavenged from before‑times supplies, living flora and fauna, and uncontaminated water sources. Enabler.

Tolerance: This hard life has built up your resistance over time, so you are trained in resisting the effects of natural poisons (such as those from plants or living creatures) and radiation. You’re also immune to natural diseases. Enabler.

Weapon at Hand: You’re practiced with all weapons. To gain this benefit with a weapon you’ve never used before, you must spend at least ten minutes practicing with it first. Enabler.

Tier 2:

Devoted Defender

Hardened by the End: You’re trained in Might defense tasks.

Tier 3:

Ability Choice: Choose either Hard to Hit or Rapid Attack as your tier 3 ability. Whatever you choose, you also gain Apocalyptic Stare.

Hard to Hit

Rapid Attack

Apocalyptic Stare: Your demeanor is of someone who shouldn’t be trifled with. You are trained in intimidation. Enabler.

Tier 4:

Improved Recovery

Push on Through

Tier 5:

Ignore the Pain

Tier 6:

Ability Choice: Choose either Using What’s Available or Wasteland Camouflage as your tier 6 ability.

Using What’s Available

Wasteland Camouflage (5+ Speed or Intellect points): By drawing your clothing about you just so and using various tricks and your deep knowledge of your surroundings, you become invisible for ten minutes in any landscape that contains ruins of the before‑times. (You may also attempt this in a purely wilderness setting, but if you do, you must spend 1 additional point from Speed or Intellect, whichever Pool you activated this power with.) While you are invisible, this asset eases your stealth and Speed defense tasks by two steps. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.

## FANTASY CHARACTER OPTIONS

In some cases, the ideas here require minor changes to the flavor described in the character options; you should work with your GM to make sure these changes are suitable for the campaign. Most of the foci in this section appear in the Cypher System; foci with an asterisk (\*) are found later in this document. Some of these options recommend swapping out a type ability for an ability from one of the character flavors such as combat, magic, or stealth. 

Alchemist: In the sense that an alchemist is someone who makes magical items or similar types of things, Adept and Explorer are appropriate type choices for academic alchemists. For a general sort of alchemist who makes potions of magical effects, choose the Masters Spells focus (instead of spells, you learn potions). For one who transforms into a powerful and dangerous creature, choose Howls at the Moon. For one who loves throwing bombs, choose Bears a Halo of Fire. For a healer, choose Works Miracles.

Assassin/Spy: Explorer and Warrior are good type choices for an assassin character. Appropriate foci are Masters Weaponry, Moves Like a Cat, Murders, and Works the Back Alleys. 

Barbarian: A barbarian character is probably a Warrior or (to focus a little more on skills than combat) an Explorer. Good foci to choose from are Lives in the Wilderness, Masters Weaponry, Needs No Weapon, Never Says Die, Performs Feats of Strength, and Rages. 

Bard: Bards in fantasy fiction and games are troubadours, minstrels, and storytellers, perhaps with a supernatural element. Bards are usually Explorers or Speakers. Appropriate foci are Entertains, Helps Their Friends, Infiltrates, and Masters Spells. 

Cleric or Priest: Academic clerics are usually Adepts or Speakers, but martial clerics are often Warriors (perhaps with magic flavor). For a typical cleric with a versatile set of abilities, choose the Channels Divine Blessings focus. 

- Cleric (death): Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits 

- Cleric (knowledge): Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Would Rather Be Reading 

- Cleric (life): Defends the Weak, Shepherds the Community, Works Miracles

- Cleric (light): Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings 

- Cleric (storm): Rides the Lightning, Thunders 

- Cleric (trickery): Takes Animal Shape\* (also see options for rogues)

-  Cleric (war): Masters Weaponry (also see options for fighters)

Druid: As a very specific sort of nature priest, a druid character is usually an Adept or Explorer (in either case probably using the magic flavor). A typical druid probably has Channels Divine Blessings or Lives in the Wilderness as a focus, but for more specific options, see the following foci: 

- Druid (animal companion): Controls Beasts, Masters the Swarm 

- Druid (elemental): Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice 

- Druid (nature affinity): Speaks for the Land 

- Druid (transformation): Abides in Stone, Takes Animal Shape\*, Walks the Wild Woods\*

Fighter: Fighters almost always have the Warrior type, but some are Explorers. A typical fighter probably has a direct focus like Masters Weaponry or Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*. For additional options based on choosing a specific fighting role, see the following: 

- Fighter (guardian): Brandishes an Exotic Shield, Defends the Gate, Masters Defense, Never Says Die, Stands Like a Bastion. 

- Fighter (melee): Fights Dirty, Fights With Panache, Looks For Trouble, Needs No Weapon, Wields Two Weapons at Once 

- Fighter (ranged): Is Licensed to Carry, Throws With Deadly Accuracy

Gunslinger: A gunslinger is probably a Warrior or Explorer, but some are Speakers with combat flavor. Appropriate foci are Is Licensed to Carry, Masters Weaponry, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*. 

Inquisitor: Inquisitors are usually Explorers, Speakers, or Warriors, depending on whether their inclinations are for having many skills, being good at interacting with people, or combat. Appropriate foci are Infiltrates, Metes Out Justice, and Operates Undercover. 

Merchant: An Explorer with a focus dealing with social interactions, like Entertains or Leads, would make a good merchant character, but the more obvious choice would be a Speaker.

Monk or Martial Artist: As masters of unarmed combat, monks are usually Warriors or Explorers (perhaps with a combat flavor). Appropriate foci are Fights With Panache, Needs No Weapon, and Throws With Deadly Accuracy. 

Paladin/Holy Knight/Paragon: As holy warriors who mix martial prowess and magic, paladins are usually Warriors or Explorers (in either case, perhaps modified with the magic flavor). Good foci for this type of character include Defends the Gate, Defends the Weak, Metes Out Justice, Slays Monsters, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*.

Ranger: Rangers mix combat and skills, and therefore are usually Explorers (perhaps with combat flavor) or Warriors (perhaps with skills and knowledge flavor). Appropriate foci for a ranger are Controls Beasts, Hunts, Lives in the Wilderness, Slays Monsters, Throws With Deadly Accuracy, and Wields Two Weapons at Once. 

Rogue or Thief: Most rogue-type characters are Explorers, but an interaction-focused rogue could easily be a Speaker (perhaps with stealth flavor). Good foci for rogues are Explores Dark Places, Fights Dirty, Hunts, Infiltrates, Is Wanted by the Law, Moves Like a Cat, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Works the Back Alleys. 

Sorcerer: Sorcerers, for our purpose here, are mages who have inherent magical abilities (as opposed to wizards, who study long and hard to get their spells). Most sorcerers are Adepts, but some are Explorers or Speakers. The Masters Spells focus gives a typical sorcerer an effective set of abilities, and most foci choices provide a themed set of spells. For sorcerers of various magical bloodlines, see the following: 

- Sorcerer (angel): Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings, Keeps a Magic Ally 

- Sorcerer (destiny): Descends From Nobility, Was Foretold

- Sorcerer (dragon): Bears a Halo of Fire, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice

- Sorcerer (elemental): Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Employs Magnetism, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice 

- Sorcerer (fey): Takes Animal Shape\* 

- Sorcerer (fiend): Bears a Halo of Fire, Keeps a Magic Ally 

- Sorcerer (undead): Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits

Trickster or Con Artist: These clever folks are typically Speakers, although they could be Adepts if they are very magical (or Explorers if they aren’t magical at all). Foci choices include Fights Dirty, Works the Back Alleys, or Entertains. 

War-wizard: For those unusual characters who use a mix of weapon attacks and spells, play a Warrior with magic flavor or an Expert with combat or magic flavor. Appropriate foci include Fights With Panache, Masters Weaponry, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*. 

Warlock or Witch: For the purposes of this list, warlocks and witches are mages who gain magical power from pacts they make with otherworldly entities. Most warlocks are Adepts, but Explorers and Speakers (perhaps with magic flavor) can be interesting options. Fun foci for a warlock include Dances With Dark Matter, Keeps a Magic Ally, Masters the Swarm, Separates Mind From Body, and Was Foretold, but (depending on the patron and pact) most sorcerer and wizard foci work just as well. 

Wild Mage: Those who use chaotic magic are usually Adepts, but a dabbler might be an Explorer or Speaker with the magic flavor. The best focus that suits this theme is Uses Wild Magic\*.

Wizard: For the purposes of this list, wizards study magical lore at length to learn the ways of spellcasting (as opposed to sorcerers, warlocks, and so on). Wizards are usually Adepts, but a person-oriented wizard might be a Speaker (perhaps with the magic flavor). For a generalist wizard who has a variety of spells, choose the Masters Spells focus. For more specific kinds of wizards, see the following: 

- Wizard (abjurer): Absorbs Energy, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Wears a Sheen of Ice 

- Wizard (conjurer or summoner): Controls Beasts, Keeps a Magic Ally 

- Wizard (diviner): Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Separates Mind From Body, Solves Mysteries Wizard (enchanter): Commands Mental Powers, Leads 

- Wizard (evoker): Bears a Halo of Fire, Blazes With Radiance, Rides the Lightning, Thunders, Wears a Sheen of Ice 

- Wizard (illusionist): Awakens Dreams, Crafts Illusions 

- Wizard (necromancer): Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits 

- Wizard (transmuter): Controls Gravity, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Takes Animal Shape\*

PREPARED VS. SPONTANEOUS SPELLCASTING

Magical characters get their abilities (which might be spells, rituals, or something else) from their type and focus, and they can use these abilities as they see fit as long as they spend the required Pool points. This technically makes them more like spontaneous casters. If you’d like to play something more like a prepared-caster wizard with a large selection of abilities that you narrow down each day, consider a spellcasting-oriented focus like Channels Divine Blessings, Masters Spells, or Speaks for the Land, and consider augmenting it with the optional spellcasting rule.

## NEW ABILITIES

Animal Scrying (4+ Intellect points): If you know the general location of an animal that is friendly toward you and within 1 mile (1.5 km) of your location, you can sense through its senses for up to ten minutes. If you are not in animal form or not in a form similar to that animal, you must apply a level of Effort to use this ability. Action to establish. 

Animal Shape (3+ Intellect points): You change into an animal as small as a rat or up to your own size (such as a large dog or small bear) for ten minutes. Each time you transform, you can take a different animal shape. Your equipment becomes part of the transformation, rendering it unusable unless it has a passive effect, such as armor. In this form your stats remain the same as your normal form, but you can move and attack according to your animal shape (attacks from most animals this size are medium weapons, which you can use without penalty). Tasks requiring hands (such as using door handles or pushing buttons) are hindered when in animal form. You cannot speak but can still use abilities that don’t rely on human speech. You gain two minor abilities associated with the creature you become (see the Animal Form Minor Abilities table). For example, if you transform into a bat, you become trained in perception and can fly up to a long distance each round. If you transform into an octopus, you are trained in stealth and can breathe underwater. If you apply a level of Effort when you use this ability, you can either become a talking animal or take a hybrid shape. The talking animal shape looks exactly like a normal animal, but you can still talk and use any abilities that rely on human speech. The hybrid shape is like your normal form but with animalistic features, even if that animal is something much smaller than you (such as a bat or rat). In this hybrid form you can speak, use all of your abilities, make attacks like an animal, and perform tasks using hands without being hindered. Anyone who sees you clearly in this hybrid form would never mistake you for a mere animal. Action to change or revert. 

“Similar” is a broad term. Lions are similar to tigers and leopards, hawks are similar to ravens and swans, dogs are similar to wolves and foxes, and so on.

Even if your animal shape has multiple attack types (such as claws and bite), you can attack only once per round unless you have some other ability that lets you make additional attacks on your turn.

Animal Shape variant: If your character concept is that you always take the same animal form instead of being able to choose from multiple kinds of animals, double the duration of the Animal Shape ability (to twenty minutes per use). The GM may allow characters with this restriction to learn additional animal forms by spending 4 XP as a long-term benefit.

Bigger Animal Shape: When you use Animal Shape, your animal form grows to about twice its normal size. Being so large, your beast form gains the following additional bonuses: +1 to Armor, +5 to your Might Pool, and you are trained in using your animal form’s natural attacks as heavy weapons (if you weren’t already). However, your Speed defense tasks are hindered. While bigger, you also gain an asset to tasks that are easier for a larger creature to perform, like climbing, intimidating, wading rivers, and so on. Enabler. 

Charge Weapon (2+ Intellect points): As part of making an attack with your enchanted weapon, you charge it with magical power, inflicting 2 additional points of energy damage. If you make more than one attack on your turn, you choose whether to spend the cost for this ability before you make each attack. Enabler. 

Cypher Casting: You can cast any of your subtle cyphers on another creature instead of yourself. You must touch the creature to affect it. Enabler. 

Cypher Surge: When you use a subtle cypher spell, as part of that action you can expend one other subtle cypher. Instead of the second cypher’s normal effect, you add one free level of Effort to the first cypher spell. Enabler.

Defending Weapon: When using your enchanted weapon, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler. 

Dreadwood (6 Intellect points): You manipulate wind, mist, and shadows to embody the primordial fear of mysterious woods. For the next minute, you gain an asset on intimidation tasks. Creatures within short range may become frightened; make a separate Intellect attack roll for each creature (if you are larger than normal from using Great Tree or another source, these rolls are eased). Success means that they are frozen in fear, not moving or taking actions for one minute or until they are attacked. Some creatures without minds might be immune to this fear. Action. 

Enchanted Movement (4+ Intellect points): You use your enchanted weapon to move yourself to any location within a long distance that you can see, as long as there are no obstacles or barriers in your way. The exact way this happens depends on your weapon; you might throw your magical hammer and be pulled along after it, shoot an arrow from your bow that pulls you forward like a grapple line, and so on. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the distance traveled; each level of Effort used in this way increases the range by another 100 feet (30 m). If you have another ability (such as from your type) that allows you to cross a long distance, the range of that ability and this one increases to very long. Action. 

Enchanted Weapon (1 Intellect point): You attune yourself to a physical weapon, such as a sword, hammer, or bow. You know exactly where it is if it is within a short distance of you, and you know its general direction and distance if farther away. All of your other focus abilities require you to be holding or wielding this weapon. You can be attuned to only one weapon at a time; attuning yourself to a second weapon loses the attunement to the first one. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete. Enabler. 

If you attune yourself to a different weapon, come up with a story reason for why you are able to do that and why you chose this new weapon

Expanded Repertoire: The number of subtle cyphers you can bear at the same time increases by one. Enabler. 

Faster Wild Magic: If you spend ten minutes preparing your magic, you can fill any of your open cypher slots with subtle cyphers chosen randomly by the GM (this time can be part of a ten-minute, one-hour, or ten-hour recovery action if you are awake for the entire time). You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour recovery action. You can still use Magical Repertoire to fill your cypher slots. Action to initiate, ten minutes to complete. 

Great Tree: When you use Wooden Body, you may grow to up to 12 feet (4 m) in height. In this larger form, you add 7 points to your Might Pool and +2 to your Might Edge. If you chose to grow, when Wooden Body ends you subtract 7 points from your Might Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, subtract the overflow first from your Speed Pool and then, if necessary, from your Intellect Pool). When you use Wooden Body, whether or not you choose to grow, instead of looking like a wooden version of your normal self, you can take on the full appearance of a humanoid tree creature or an actual tree (including growing additional branches, extra foliage, and so on). This does not affect any of your abilities—in tree shape, you can use type abilities, other focus abilities, and so on. In tree shape, pretending to be a tree and hiding among normal trees are eased by two steps. Enabler.

Innate Power: Choose either your Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When spending points to activate your focus abilities, you can spend points from this Pool instead of your Intellect Pool (in which case you use your Might Edge or Speed Edge instead of your Intellect Edge, as appropriate). Enabler

Lend Animal Shape (6+ Intellect points): You change into an animal, and one willing creature within immediate range also transforms into an animal of that type (bear, tiger, wolf, and so on) for ten minutes, as if they were using your Animal Shape ability. For each level of Effort applied, you can affect one additional creature. All creatures transforming with you must be your size or smaller. A creature can revert to its normal form as an action, but it cannot then change back into the animal form. One creature (whether you or someone else) changing form does not affect any other creature affected with this ability. Action.

A creature that takes animal form with Lend Animal Shape counts as an animal for the use of Animal Scrying.

A character might be able to take the shape of a creature that is similar to a common animal, such as a unicorn instead of a horse or a basilisk instead of a lizard, but doing so should require applying at least one level of Effort to the change, and the character wouldn’t gain any of the creature’s magical abilities.

Magical Repertoire: The number of subtle cyphers you can bear at the same time increases by two. If you spend one hour preparing your magic, you can fill any of your open cypher slots with subtle cyphers chosen randomly by the GM (this hour can be part of a one-hour or ten-hour recovery action if you are awake for the entire time). As part of this preparation process, you may discard any number of subtle cyphers you carry to make room for more subtle cyphers. Enabler.

If a character has Magical Repertoire, the GM should give the PC frequent opportunities to gain new subtle cyphers, whether from preparation or by gaining them automatically as explained in the Cyphers chapter

Magical Training: You are trained in all of your spells. As a result, you ease any task involved in the use of your spells. Enabler.

Maximize Cypher: Choose one subtle cypher you bear. Its level becomes the maximum level possible for that cypher. For example, a meditation aid has a level range of 1d6 + 2, so maximizing that cypher changes its level to 8. You can have only one maximized subtle cypher at a time. You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour recovery action. Enabler.

Patient Recovery: You gain an extra ten-minute recovery roll each day. Enabler.

Power Crash (3 Intellect points): You strike your enchanted weapon against the ground (or a similar large surface), creating an explosion of energy that affects an area up to immediate range from that point. (If your enchanted weapon is a ranged weapon, you can instead target a point within close range to be the center of the explosion.) The blast inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or objects within the area (except for you). Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.

Restorative Bloom (5 Might points): When Wooden Body or Great Tree is in effect, you produce a flower, acorn, fruit, or similar plant-based edible item. A creature that eats this food is nourished for a full day and restores their Might Pool, Speed Pool, and Intellect Pool to their maximum values, as if they were fully rested. Eating a second food produced by this ability in a day has no effect. If the food is not eaten within ten minutes, it spoils. Action to produce, action to eat.

Throw Enchanted Weapon: You can throw your enchanted weapon up to short range as a light ranged weapon. Whether it hits or misses, it immediately flies back to your hands, and you can automatically catch it or allow it to land at your feet. Enabler.

Tree Companion (5+ Intellect points): You animate a tree of approximately your size or smaller, creating a level 3 creature with 1 Armor. The tree follows your verbal commands for one hour, after which it reverts to a normal tree (and roots itself where it stands). Unless the tree is killed by damage, you can animate it again when the ability duration expires, but any damage it has carries over to its newly animated state. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more trees; each level of Effort used affects one additional tree. Action.

Tree Travel (4+ Intellect points): You enter one tree and instantaneously and safely emerge from another one within long distance. You don’t need to specify which tree you’re exiting from (if you know there are trees in that direction, you can decide how far to go and you will step out of a tree in that area). If the starting tree’s trunk isn’t as large as your body, you must apply a level of Effort to enter it. You can choose to use Effort to increase the distance you travel; one level of Effort used in this way increases the range to very long, two levels raise it to one mile (1.5 km), and each additional level of Effort beyond that increases it by an additional mile. Action.

Wild Insight: You gain a momentary perfect understanding of the flow of magic around you at this moment. When preparing your magic, choose one specific subtle cypher and make a magical lore skill roll against level 6. If you succeed, you gain that subtle cypher (the cypher’s level is 6); if you fail, you get a random subtle cypher. If you aren’t sure what specific subtle cypher you want, you can ask for a broad category such as “healing,” “movement,” or “skill”; this eases the magical lore task, and if you succeed, the GM chooses a random cypher that fits that category. You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour recovery action. Enabler.

Wooden Body (1+ Might points): You transform your body into living wood for ten minutes, which grants you several benefits. You gain +1 to Armor and you are practiced in using your limbs as medium weapons. You need about one-tenth as much air as a human. Hiding among trees or on a tree is eased. However, in your wooden form you move more stiffly than a creature of flesh, hindering your Speed defense rolls. Action to change or revert.

Your wooden body might be smooth like a polished board, rough like tree bark, or a mix of both.

Aquatic: The animal either breathes water instead of air or is able to breathe water in addition to breathing air.

Armor: The animal has a thick hide or shell, granting +1 to Armor.

Constrict: The animal can grip its opponent fast after making a melee attack (usually with a bite or claw), easing attack rolls against that foe on later turns until the animal releases the foe.

Fast: The animal can move a long distance on its turn instead of a short distance.

Flying: The animal can fly, which (depending on the type of animal) may be up to a short or long distance on its turn.

Hands: The animal has paws or hands that are nearly as agile as those of a human. Unlike with most animal shapes, the animal’s tasks that require hands are not hindered (although the GM may decide that some tasks requiring human agility, such as playing a flute, are still hindered).

Scent: The animal has a strong sense of smell, gaining an asset on tracking and dealing with darkness or blindness.

Small: The animal is considerably smaller than a human, easing its Speed defense tasks but hindering tasks to move heavy things.

Venom: The animal is poisonous (usually through a bite), inflicting 1 additional point of damage.

FANTASY SPECIES 

For many fantasy worlds, there is a plethora of sapient creatures suitable for player characters. Here we present additional options, which a player can choose for their character in place of their descriptor

## VARIANT RULE: TWO DESCRIPTORS

By having dwarf, elf, or other species take the place of a character’s descriptor, it creates a situation where only human characters have the variability of choosing a descriptor that suits their personality. The GM might instead allow all human characters to have two descriptors, and nonhuman characters to have a standard descriptor in addition to their species descriptor.

Sometimes contradictory descriptors might weaken or negate each other’s benefits and drawbacks. If one descriptor gives training in a skill and another gives an inability in that skill, they cancel each other out and the character doesn’t have any modifier for that skill at all.

DESCRIPTORS AS SPECIES 

If a player wants to play a nearly human species without any exceptional or unique special abilities, it’s easy for a GM to pick an appropriate descriptor and use it as that species’ descriptor. A greyhound-like species might have the Fast descriptor.

## CATFOLK

You are unmistakably feline. Your people have fur; large, pointed ears; sharp teeth and claws; and even tails. You are nimble, graceful, and quick. An ancient and sophisticated culture, your people have their own language, customs, and traditions developed in relative seclusion over the centuries. Neither conquerors nor conquered, the success of your society has come from the fact that you have given most others a wide berth. As a people, you almost never get involved in wars or similar matters, which has given other cultures the idea that you are aloof, unapproachable, or mysterious. As long as they leave you alone, what they think is fine with you. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Agile: +4 to your Speed Pool. Skill: You are trained in climbing and balance tasks. 

Bared Claws: Even unarmed, your claws are light weapons that inflict 4 points of damage. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. You were curious as to what the other PCs were up to. 

2\. You needed to get out of town, and the PCs were going in the same direction as you. 

3\. You are interested in making a profit, and the other PCs seem to have a lead on doing just that. 

4\. It seemed like a lark.

## DRAGONFOLK

You have scales, fangs, claws, and magic—gifts of the dragons. You might have been born of dragonfolk parents, willingly transformed in a magical ceremony, or chosen by a dragon to be their agent or champion. You have a great destiny before you, but it is your choice whether to make it your own or bend to the will of those who made you what you are. Some people mistrust or fear you, and others consider you a prophet or wish to exploit your power for their own goals. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Sturdy: +2 to your Might Pool. Skill: You are trained in intimidation

Dragonbreath (3 Might points): You breathe out a blast of energy in an immediate area. Choose one type of energy (arcane, cold, fire, thorn, and so on); the blast inflicts 2 points of damage of this kind of energy (ignores Armor) to all creatures or objects within the area. Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action. 

Draconic Resistance: You gain +2 Armor against the type of energy you create with your dragonbreath. 

Scaly: +1 to Armor. Inability: You have difficulty relating to non-dragons. Tasks to persuade non-dragons are hindered. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

1\. You believe the other PCs can help you solve a mystery about your heritage. 

2\. You needed to get out of town, and the PCs were going in the same direction as you. 

3\. Your creator, master, or mentor told you to help the PCs. 

4\. You want to make a name for yourself, and the other PCs seem competent and compatible.

## GNOME

You are curious and love discovering ways to turn found things into art, tools, or weapons. You might be a sculptor, smith, artist, chef, storyteller, or inventor. Alchemy, magic, and engineering fascinate you. Other beings may see you as a strange mix of a nature-loving elf and a craft-obsessed dwarf, but you and your kind are unique people with a passion for life, exploration, and creation. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Genius: +2 to your Intellect Pool. 

Skill: You are trained in two skills that suit your creative nature, such as alchemy, smithing, poetry, cooking, woodcarving, or pottery. 

Skill: You are practiced in using hammers. 

Natural Affinity: You gain one of the following abilities: Communication, Eyes Adjusted, or Minor Illusion. 

Inability: Your small size makes some physical tasks difficult. Might-based tasks are hindered. 

Additional Equipment: You have a bag of light tools or a bag of heavy tools.

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. You think an object or material you’ve been looking for can be found where the other PCs are going. 

2\. You were recruited because of your knowledge on a particular subject.

3\. You were bored and it sounded like the PCs were going to do something interesting. 

4\. You owe one of the PCs a favor for a useful gift in the past.

## HALFLING

Three feet tall and proud, you are fond of the comforts of home but itching for a little adventure now and then. Small and quick, you have a way of getting along with everyone. You might have been raised in a halfling village, a mixed community where humans and the small folk work and eat side by side as friends, or a less welcoming environment where your people get things done using deception and criminal activity. You and humans have a lot in common—you’re just more compact and efficient about it. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool. 

Skill: You are trained in pleasant social interactions. 

Skill: You are trained in stealth. 

Skill: You are trained in Intellect defense. 

Advantage: When you use 1 XP to reroll a d20 for any roll that affects only you, add 3 to the reroll. 

Inability: Your small size makes some physical tasks difficult. Might-based tasks are hindered. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. You were fleeing someone and literally ran into the other PCs. 

2\. You were invited (or invited yourself) as a good luck charm. 

3\. You were tricked into going with the other PCs or were brought along despite your very reasonable objections. 

4\. You’re very protective of another PC and want to make sure they get through the upcoming challenges.

## LIZARDFOLK

You are from a long line of fierce reptilian predators. You show your fangs and scales proudly. Your people survive and thrive in the wetlands, guarding their eggs, raising their hatchlings, and protecting their territory. City-builders may call you a savage and your culture primitive, but there is grace in your hunting, artistry in your crafting, joy in your songs, and reverence in your worship. 

You gain the following characteristics: 

Agile: +2 to your Speed Pool. 

Skill: You are trained in balancing, jumping, and swimming. 

Skill: You are trained in hunting and tracking. 

Skill: You are practiced in using javelins and spears. 

Scaly: +1 to Armor. 

Inability: Your slightly clawed hands make fine detail work difficult. You have an inability with picking locks, picking pockets, and other manual dexterity tasks (but not crafting). 

Additional Equipment: You have a spear and a pair of javelins. 

Initial Link to the Starting Adventure: From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure. 

1\. The other PCs were lost in your territory and you were sent to escort them out. 

2\. Something has been attacking your community and you want to find and destroy it. 

3\. You were exiled from your community and need to prove your worthiness before you can return to it. 

4\. You or your priest had a vision of you traveling with the other PCs.

CREATURES AND NPCs

## MODERN MAGIC CREATURES

BARGAINER FIEND 3 (9)

Bargainer fiends are natives of “hell dimensions” whose job is to come to the mortal world and convince people to barter or trade their souls. Their natural shape is usually a lanky humanoid with horns, claws, vestigial bat wings, and a forked tail, with a faint smell of brimstone, but they can partially or completely disguise themselves as humans to tempt and advise mortals.

Typical devils are warriors and torturers, and demons are mortal souls reforged into entities of pure spite and hate, whereas bargainer fiends see themselves as classier beings with loftier goals. However, bargainers are aware that they are weaker than their counterparts, and they make sure they don’t do any front-line fighting if they can help it.

Motive: Bargain for souls

Environment: Anywhere humans can be found

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Deception as level 5

Combat: A bargainer fiend attacks with a punch or a firearm. If they aren’t trying to hide their inhuman nature, they throw short-range bolts of painful hellfire, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the target for one round.

The heart of a bargainer fiend’s power is its ability to arrange for rewards for a mortal client in exchange for the client’s soul. Typical rewards are training in a skill, learning a new type or focus ability, wealth equivalent to one exorbitant item, an artifact, or anything else that can be acquired by spending 4 XP. The price is always the client’s mortal soul, usually after a specific time period. Bigger demands by the client require the fiend to get approval from their superiors, and the price is higher, but usually still manageable.

A bargainer fiend can use an action to transform themself into a human or near-human form (such as a human with devil horns) or return to their natural form. They can assume the guise of a specific human (such as a person their client knows) only if that human is dead or has an agreement with a bargainer fiend.

Interaction: Bargainer fiends serve at the pleasure of their infernal masters, and they know their lives are forfeit if they ever fail. This colors their interactions with clients; they will say anything to accomplish their mission, and their only true loyalty is to the fiend who created and controls them.

Use: A motivational speaker offers to teach clients confidence and charm, with great results. An old sorcerer knows some rare magic for those willing to pay a steep price. A mysterious person has been seen visiting people in the terminal ward of various hospitals.

Loot: A bargainer fiend may have a cypher relating to their duties or as a gift or payment for a client, but most of their material riches are hell-crafted and not safe to carry for long.

DIVINITY OF THE CITY 8 (24)

Divinities of the city are a pantheon of modern-era demigods who have a strong connection to some aspect of urban life. They get their powers from their connection to a modern element that’s being worshipped. For example, the Divinity of Defacement gains power when someone creates graffiti or stares in wonder at a mural, while the Divinity of Urban Creatures grows stronger each time someone saves a turtle from a highway or shivers at coyotes’ calls. Divinities look mostly humanoid, but their appearance has some tie to their connection. The Divinity of Defacement might wear graffiti-themed clothing, the Divinity of Urban Creatures might have a bear’s head, and the Divinity of Architecture might have gargoyle wings.

Motive: Defense; protection; power

Environment: Urban landscapes

Health: 75

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short; long when flying

Combat: Divinities attack a foe up to a long distance away with a spell related to their connection (sending a pack of rabid raccoons after a foe, lifting a highway, or having a mural attack). These attacks inflict 8 points of damage on a single target or, if the divinity chooses, the attack hits all targets within short range of the destination for 6 points of damage.

Most divinities have a close-range attack as well, such as turning into a coyote and attacking their target with tooth and claw or grabbing a painted weapon out of a wall mural.

Divinities also have a number of additional spells, including:

Animate: Turns any material into an animate level 4 creature. The creature has a mind and will of its own, and acts just as that type of creature would act if it were born instead of created.

Forever Space: Creates an endless length of alleys, roads, or bridges between itself and all characters it chooses within long range. Characters must succeed on a level 5 Intellect defense task to find an exit. While moving through the forever space, characters take 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) each round.

Heal: The divinity heals themself, a creature, or an object for 5 points of damage.

Illusion: Divinities can cast elaborate and convincing illusions over their domain, making the area seem more appealing, beautiful, or dangerous. Illusions cover up to a ten-block area and last for up to an hour. Seeing through one is a level 8 task.

Interaction: Divinities rarely care about humans unless they’re connected to their particular part of the urban landscape. Sometimes they can be persuaded or negotiated with, but not if the character has previously damaged or endangered the divinity’s connection—for example, a poacher of urban wildlife probably has no chance of interacting positively with a Divinity of Urban Creatures.

Use: A divinity is a powerful aggressive or defensive force, putting the PCs in a position where they must fight or negotiate to prevent death and destruction. In addition to situations where a divinity clashes with those who would exploit them, they may have information or unique magic (such as an unlocking spell) that the characters need to reach a goal.

Loot: Divinities rarely carry anything of interest to humans, but they might bequeath to allies a powerful artifact related to some aspect of their domain.

ELEMENTAL, ELECTRICITY 4 (12)

Electricity elementals alternate between a feral-looking humanoid energy form and a near-spherical cloud of intensely glowing sparks. They spontaneously arise when supernatural events take place near high-voltage wires or electrical substations, and their high rate of speed often means they’ve traveled hundreds of miles before anyone realizes they appeared. Extremely mobile and curious, they inadvertently or deliberately cause harm wherever they go.

Motive: Explore and shock

Environment: Anywhere electricity can easily reach

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short; very long with electrical conduction

Modifications: Attacks and Speed defense as level 5 due to quickness; stealth as level 2 due to buzzing noise

Combat: An electricity elemental strikes twice each round with a limb, or fires one bolt of electricity at a target within short range.

As its action, an elemental can heal itself for up to 4 points of health by draining power from a touched electrical machine, creature (such as a robot), manifest cypher, or artifact. A drained object moves one step down the object damage track. A drained robot takes 4 points of damage. A drained manifest cypher is fully consumed and useless. A drained artifact immediately checks for depletion (artifacts with a depletion of “—” are either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 for this purpose).

An electricity elemental can pass through conductive materials at full speed, ignoring obstacles and difficult terrain. An electricity elemental can power any electrical device that runs on household power, but it’s uncomfortable for them and they don’t like doing it.

Interaction: Electricity elementals are somewhat intelligent but perceive and think at much faster rates than humans, so they quickly become frustrated with “slow” communication. They can be summoned and controlled with magic, but there’s a 10% chance the elemental breaks free of the spell and attacks or flees.

Use: Power grid fluctuations throughout the city may be the result of a roving electricity elemental. Something exploded every car battery along a major street. Something noisy has taken over the eccentric inventor’s workshop.

GARGOYLE 4 (12)

Gargoyles are stone beings of many shapes and sizes that often start their lives as inanimate decor. However, few stay that way forever. Most alternate between dormancy and animated life during the course of their long existence.

Although their original purpose was to guard places, they are excellent at guarding almost anything, including other living beings. They can become deeply attached to these places and people, and their loyalty also makes them solid friends, companions, and even familiars.

Gargoyles may look like frogs, bunnies, demons, dragons, or any other creature real or imagined. They often (but not always) have wings.

Motive: Guarding

Environment: Cities, especially on older buildings

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short; long while flying

Modifications: Seeing through deception, stealth, hiding, and sneaking as level 6

Combat: Most gargoyles don’t wish to fight and will do so only reluctantly or if something or someone they’re guarding is threatened. Their most basic attack is to throw or fly themselves fully at their foe, hitting the target with their entire body for 4 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor), but they may claw twice, inflicting 4 points of damage with each attack.

Gargoyles can see in darkness as if it were daylight.

Gargoyles have a number of additional combat options and other abilities at their disposal, including the following:

Awaken Friend: Awaken another gargoyle out of its inanimate state and ask it to help. This other gargoyle must be within short range, it acts on the same initiative as the asking gargoyle, and it can take actions starting the turn after it is awakened.

Bulwark: Grow to twice their size to prevent others from getting through a doorway or other opening. They are able to stretch out their wings, limbs, and even other body parts to fill the entirety of the space.While in this form they cannot move or attack, but they can return to their normal size as part of another action.

Take the Attack: Move up to a short distance on someone else’s turn to take an attack directed at the person, place, or object they’re guarding. Other than the distance traveled, this works like the taking the attack cooperative action. (Typically, the gargoyle relies on its Armor to absorb most of this damage.)

Water Spout: Open their mouth and emit a powerful short-distance stream of water that inflicts 4 points of damage to everyone in its path.

Interaction: While gargoyles can be conscripted and tricked into guarding, they’re much more likely to throw themselves into the job if someone takes the time to earn their loyalty. They are not always the smartest, but they are very “grumpy sunshine” and often quite funny.

Use: Gargoyles work best when used to defend something. PCs can end up at odds with a gargoyle who thinks (incorrectly or correctly) that their beloved building is in danger, or have to find a gargoyle that for some reason has gone missing from their customary perch.

Gargoyle Names: All gargoyles have a name, even those that may not have left their dormancy for the first time. However, few will tell someone their real name, as they have a healthy fear of that knowledge being used for ill. Instead, they offer up a nickname, usually something similar, at least until they learn to trust someone fully.

HAUNTED CAR 5 (15)

Whether you call them haunted, possessed, misenchanted, cursed, or just plain evil, some cars develop a hateful will, the ability to drive themselves, and a love for the smell of blood on asphalt.

A haunted car makes a bond with a chosen driver—usually someone with a similarly evil nature, or a meek person the car can influence and control. Over time, the driver might physically transform due to the car’s influence, becoming more attractive, confident, and cruel. The car is jealous of anyone interested in its chosen driver, either pushing the driver to turn them away or hunting them down on its own.

A haunted car has an empathic connection with its chosen driver, conveying simple emotions and desires when within short range. It otherwise is limited to whatever it can play on its radio, using snippets of songs (typically from the era it was made) as threats or taunts toward its next victims.

A haunted car lets itself be driven by its chosen driver, but it is capable of driving itself with great skill and can operate any moveable part of itself (doors, locks, trunk, and so on).

> Chosen driver: level 2, social interaction as level 1, driving and repairs as level 3
>
> A chosen driver trained or indoctrinated by a haunted car might develop abilities similar to the Drives Like a Maniac focus or, if they can use magic, the Is a Car Wizard focus.

Motive: Violence and vengeance

Environment: Anywhere cars can go

Health: 20

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2 or 3

Movement: Long (or faster outside of combat)

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size; stealth as level 3 due to size and engine noise

Combat: A haunted car attacks by colliding with or running over a foe, inflicting 6 points of damage. If the car does nothing but move at least a short distance on its turn, its attack in the next round is eased and inflicts an additional 5 points of damage. If a foe is within it, the car moves its interior parts (seats, seat belts, and so on) to crush and choke them, tries to force them out with an open door and a hard turn, or (if all else fails) crashes in an attempt to eject the passenger through the windshield.

A haunted car can drive itself a long distance each round and still take another action (such as attacking). Most can reach an overland speed of up to 100 miles per hour (160 kph).

A haunted car with at least 1 health recovers a few points of health every hour. The chosen driver can double this rate by actively repairing the car.

Interaction: A haunted car doesn’t converse or bargain. It lurks, using engine noises and evocative songs from its radio to intimidate and threaten anyone it wants to kill.

Use: Haunted cars go looking for trouble or to hurt those who harmed them or their driver.

Loot: A haunted car created by magic might have a few strange bits that can be used as magical cyphers. Otherwise, it’s worth whatever cash a chop shop or junkyard will pay for it—assuming that won’t just spread its malice to other vehicles . . .

HELL MARY 5 (15)

Say her name thirteen times, but only if you dare. Over the ages, Hell Mary has been rumored to be a ghost, a witch, a demon, and a hoax, and perhaps she has been all of these over time. But now she is none of these and more—over the years of worship and wonder and whispers, she has morphed into something far greater than the sum of her parts.

Now she is a demon, built of blood and bone and sustained purely by revenge.

Those who wish to call her merely need say her name thirteen times while looking into a mirror (or just three times if the mirror has magic of any kind to it). Those who seek revenge may call upon her for aid, but only if she deems their need worthy. Those who call her on a whim or a dare will shortly find themselves in dire straits.

In the mirror, she looks at first like a glare of light, then as a skeleton or dead body, then as a woman with the face of a nightmare—empty eye sockets and a single bloodshot eye in her forehead. Her mouth is full of sharpened teeth, and the claws of her hands are curled and silver‑tipped. Her skin and dress are so coated in blood it’s impossible to tell where they end and she begins. As she starts to crawl from the mirror, she moves faster and faster until she pulls herself fully free as a corporeal being. Typically, Hell Mary will not attack creatures that she deems as innocent or unworthy of revenge, unless they provoke her in some way.

Motive: Revenge

Environment: Anywhere with a mirror

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intimidation as level 7

Combat: Hell Mary merely has to scream at, strangle, or scratch a foe within immediate range to inflict 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).

She can curse a creature within short range to experience intense fear, stunning them for a minute or until they succeed at an Intellect defense roll to break free.

She can possess a willing summoner for a few rounds in order to enact revenge on their behalf. During this time her summoner can only watch, feel, and listen as Hell Mary gets them their retribution.

Interaction: Hell Mary only cares about one thing— revenge. All other topics are likely to fall upon deaf ears.

Use: A character was attacked and calls upon Hell Mary to help them seek revenge. Someone is using Hell Mary to seek revenge (rightfully or wrongfully) upon a character.

INTERNET D@EMON 3 (9)

Weird apps and viruses are a frequent problem on internet-enabled devices, even more so when magic is brought into the mix. Internet d@emons are semi-sentient bits of code that live in computers and smart devices. Initially created to be harmless or even helpful (fulfilling a simple purpose such as converting files, refining data searches, or anonymizing an IP address), they’ve become aggressive and malicious, either deliberately created to cause harm or bucking the constraints of their original code to evolve and multiply. Unsuspecting sorcerers might grab a magical app that promises quicker access to difficult spells or insight on the next big crypto drop, accidentally infecting their devices with a dangerous techno-magical creature.

Most magicians draw the attention of an internet d@emon by using malware cypher apps like EasyMagic.

> Internet d@emons have grown beyond their original programming and function like creatures rather than simple software— essentially, they’re a sort of magical limited artificial intelligence. They’re immune to abilities that only affect non-sentient programs.
>
> Some magicians have tried partnering with a d@emon, allowing it to feed on their magic in exchange for a daily magic-enhancing cypher, but the d@emon’s hunger usually grows too strong for it to resist taking more magic than the character planned for.

Motive: Hunger for magic

Environment: Computers, smart devices, and areas with strong wireless internet access

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; travels through the internet at nearly instantaneous speed

Modifications: Speed defense, perception, and stealth as level 5

Combat: A d@emon outside of an internet‑connected device attacks by siphoning magic from a creature within short range, inflicting 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). However, usually the d@emon prefers to remain hidden within a computer or smart device, slowly and gently draining magic from a nearby creature without being noticed.

When a magic-capable creature uses a ten‑minute, one-hour, or ten-hour recovery roll within immediate range of a device with an internet d@emon, subtract 1 from the result of the recovery roll. Over time, the d@emon’s siphoning power strengthens, increasing to 2 or even 3 points taken from every recovery roll. An affected creature can attempt a perception task against the d@emon’s stealth modifier to realize that something is tapping into their magic.

If the character discovers which app or device the d@emon is associated with, deleting the app or destroying the device forces the d@emon to either flee through the internet (requiring its action for one to three rounds, depending on local transmission speeds) or immediately manifest in its visible physical form. If manifested, a d@emon attempts to feed on the weakest foe in the area, and once it is sated it leaves the area (breaking off combat if possible) to find a high-speed wireless internet connection so it can transmit itself far away in search of another victim.

> Once per day, an internet d@emon can create a malware magical app cypher (such as EasyMagic.app), placing it in an app store (physical or online) or sending out a burst of emails with a link to where the app can be downloaded.
>
> Interaction: D@emons are persistent and reasonably clever. They can be bargained with or bribed, but they tend to be greedy and would rather hide or pretend to leave than make a deal.
>
> Use: An internet d@emon usually starts out as an innocuous app subtly draining magic, then switches to an active, aggressive mode when discovered or if starved.

Loot: A destroyed internet d@emon’s physical form leaves behind a lace-like fragment of magical energy that functions as a meditation aid cypher.

POLLUTION GOBLIN 2 (6)

Pollution goblins are strange child-sized creatures that arise in environments where pollution or toxic waste is common. Their green skin is covered in scabs and pustules, except where it looks melted by acid, and their eyes have a wicked green glow that’s faintly visible in the dark. They don’t seem to have much of a culture or society, roaming around polluted areas like scavenging insects. They often ignore each other’s presence and never attack each other, but they immediately unite against a common foe if any of them are threatened. A pollution goblin’s semi-liquefied body can slide up or down any firm surface, allowing them to climb anywhere with ease. Pollution goblins have bones and internal organs, but they’re oddly shaped and don’t match those of any known creature. Because of this, and how they quickly melt away if killed, they might actually be artificial beings like homunculi, or inanimate matter given life like an elemental. They seem to arise spontaneously in locations where pollution reaches a threshold, and they don’t reproduce in the normal biological sense. Pollution goblins are stupid and easily tricked, but it doesn’t take long for them to realize they’ve been deceived, and they always make sure to punish someone who fools them.

Motive: Hunger for flesh; spreading filth

Environment: Anywhere there is pollution, in groups of three to ten

Health: 8

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Armor: 1 (5 against poison and radiation)

Movement: Short; short when climbing

Modifications: Might defense as level 3; perception and stealth as level 5; see through deception as level 1

Combat: Pollution goblins use scavenged weapons to attack prey at range, preferring stolen pistols (usually with only one or two bullets left) or hurled containers of toxic goo. When up close, they bite.

A pollution goblin’s body is infused with dangerous chemicals. Any person spending their turn within immediate range of a pollution goblin must succeed at a Might defense roll or become sick. Within an hour, all their tasks are hindered, and for every 24 hours that pass, they must make another Might defense roll or move one step down the damage track (a success ends the sickness).

Pollution goblins regain 2 points of health per round.

Interaction: Pollution goblins have a rudimentary understanding of whatever human language is dominant in their area. Most conversations with them are about acquiring food and protecting and expanding their territory (which means spreading contaminants over a wider area).

Use: Pollution goblins are an early symptom of a larger and greater problem. By the time a group of them is discovered, the area is already poisoned and will take time and money to contain and clean up.

TELEVISION THOUGHTFORM 3 (9)

A television thoughtform is a nexus of images and videos from TV programming, brought to life—usually accidentally—by unconscious or deliberate magic. Typically, the thoughtform looks like a specific television character in the real world, but objects and even locations have been known to manifest as thoughtforms. The thoughtform isn’t initially aware that they’re a manifestation of a fictional television program, but over time they usually come to realize their artificial origin and that the “world” they lived in and the people they knew there weren’t real. Most thoughtforms adapt to their new situation, but some have a traumatic response to their new reality and become dangerous.

> A thoughtform is a thought or idea made real, usually through intense belief, concentration, or magic. Buddhist philosophy has a similar concept called a “tulpa.”
>
> It’s possible to create a thoughtform of a real person out of documentary footage, newscasts, interviews, or other media where the person on the screen is portraying themselves. These thoughtforms tend to have a poor time adjusting to a reality where they are an artificial copy of a real person, rejected by their friends and loved ones.

Motive: Acceptance; adjustment to the real world

Environment: Anywhere their fictional self would feel comfortable

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 or 6 points (see below)

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intellect defense as level 4; assuming their fictional role as level 5

Combat: Television thoughtforms attack using whatever methods are appropriate for their character. For most people, this means improvised weapons like chairs and baseball bats, inflicting 3 points of damage. Battle-competent characters such as police officers, sci-fi soldiers, and fantasy heroes tend to use lethal weapons like pistols and swords, inflicting 6 points of damage.

Thoughtforms can incidentally alter their own reality in small ways relevant to their fictional self, such as suddenly changing outfits to match the situation, producing useful equipment (like a weapon or mobile phone) out of nothing, or instantly recovering 3 points of health. The thoughtform usually hand-waves how they were able to do this; pressing them on these abilities eventually leads to them learning that they’re a thoughtform. These abilities might happen automatically as part of the thoughtform’s action, or they might use an action to duck out of sight and return after the change has happened.

Interaction: A thoughtform that’s ignorant of their true nature acts exactly as their fictional self would. An aware thoughtform develops their own personality over time, which might be similar to their fictional persona or radically different as a rebellion against how they were “forced” to act.

> Use: Thoughtforms create quirky, interesting, and misleading encounters where PCs and NPCs mistake them for cosplayers, famous actors, people experiencing delusions (about a fictional city or a “hologram program”), or odd local residents (such as a hard-boiled detective or a high-school sports hero or bully). They sometimes know secret information about the media they’re from.

Loot: Although a dead thoughtform and their equipment slowly fades away into nothingness, sometimes they leave behind an interesting cypher.

URBAN BROWNIE 3 (9)

While most people are familiar with rural brownies with their wizened, ragged appearance and their penchant for helping with farming tasks, the urban brownie is a very different type of entity. Having adapted to live in cities and decent-sized towns, urban brownies tend to care much more about their appearance and prefer less outdoorsy forms of labor.

Most are natty dressers, often altering the clothing of large dolls or young children to create well-heeled outfits for themselves. They prefer to have their own private spaces in people’s homes or businesses, but will inhabit small shelters or niches if they can’t find any other home. Many live in coffee shops, finding the offerings of caffeine and pastries well worth the tasks they perform in thanks (usually cleaning, making elegantly lettered signs, and organizing cupboards). They’re most active in the evenings and overnight, but some choose to acclimate to the rhythm of the city they live in and can be seen during the day.

A brownie who feels insulted, disrespected, or unappreciated will quickly become malicious and spread word about whoever treated them so poorly.

Motive: Comfort and security

Environment: Homes and shops where food is present

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense and movement as level 4 due to size and quickness; perception, riddles, and tricks as level 4

Combat: Brownies are tricksters through and through, and nearly all their abilities fall into this category.

Mend: Spend two rounds mending something that is broken (up to level 5). The item works for two rounds before it returns to its broken state. (This ability does not work on used cyphers or depleted artifacts.)

Needle and Thread: Magically sew a creature’s clothing, shoes, accessories, or skin to something else, making it difficult for the creature to move. The creature’s actions are hindered until they succeed on a level 3 Might defense roll to break free.

No See Me: Take the shape of a small object in the vicinity, such as a cookie jar, shoe, or vase. The brownie is indistinguishable from the object, and the effect lasts for one minute or until they take a combat action.

Put That Anywhere: Move an item within short range in such a way that it trips up and injures a foe, such as slamming a door closed, knocking a rake across a pathway, or dropping a chandelier from the ceiling. The foe takes 3 points of damage and, depending on the circumstances, may be knocked prone if they fail a Might defense roll.

> Shine-Shine-Shine: Spend two rounds making a (willing) person, place, or thing so pretty that it is wonderful to look upon. All foes are unable to look away for one round and lose their next action. All allies are bolstered by the beauty and gain an asset on their next action.
>
> Interaction: Brownies are typically mischievous and tricky, with a love of puns, riddles, and puzzles. They appreciate those who appreciate them and are a bit like crows in that they long-remember the faces of those who have helped or harmed them.

Use: Brownies are usually supportive characters in a story, but they may be vexing tricksters—or even outright antagonists if living in a home where the primary foe (or a player character) mistreats them. They’re usually overlooked by nonmagical people, so they often witness secret events and have interesting information.

> \*Rural brownies have the same stats as urban brownies. The differences between them are mostly in appearance and personality, as rural brownies tend to dress in rags, prefer to work at night, and are not opposed to doing manual labor outdoors in all manner of weather—provided they’re well-rewarded.

VULTURE SPIRIT 3(9)

Vulture spirits look like tall humans with bald heads and horrible, hunched posture. They blend in, and they like it that way. Vulture spirits subsist on other people’s pain and misery, which has led to a bad reputation that’s hard to shake.

Despite prevalent misconceptions, vulture spirits generally prefer not to cause pain and misery—they just feed on what’s already present, providing relief in the process. They’re gentle and reserved, with soft, scratchy voices. The most well-known and well-respected vulture spirits work in medical professions and form symbiotic relationships with their patients.

Motive: Consume anguish

Environment: Anywhere pain and misery can be found

Health: 10

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intellect defense, perception, and stealth as level 5

Combat: Vulture spirits are rarely violent; they attack when threatened, to defend chosen allies, or out of desperation. A dying vulture spirit may use their last strength to pounce on a creature they judge to be an easy target, subsequently using the pain they inflict to restore their own health.

Vulture spirits gain 1 point of health for every minute spent in physical contact with someone (other than a vulture spirit) experiencing pain or suffering, such as a creature below half its normal health or Pool points, a debilitated PC, or someone with a chronic illness. Recovery rolls made while in contact with a vulture spirit are increased by 3 points.

A vulture spirit can use the following magical abilities.

Recalling the Worst: Open their mouth and emit a short-distance blast of energy. If the foe fails an Intellect defense roll, they take 4 points of damage and lose their next action as they relive their worst memory.

Remote Draining: If a creature within short range is experiencing pain or suffering, the vulture spirit can use their action to drain it from that creature. The spirit gains 1 point of health and the creature’s affliction is alleviated for one round.

Interaction: Vulture spirits are clever and shy. They can speak human languages but revert to bird sounds such as screeching, clicking, and trilling when stressed. Though they forage for pain to consume alone, they prefer to live in large groups.

Use: Vulture spirits are good for creating eerie encounters about sickness and pain, especially if the player characters mistake the spirit as the cause of the trouble rather than incidental to it.

Loot: A vulture spirit’s pockets are full of feathers, altogether which function as a curative cypher.

WITCHFOX 4 (12)

A witchfox is a supernatural creature whose natural form is that of a fox, but they can transform into a human form and walk among regular people. Like humans, some are evil, some are good, and most are in the middle, but many of the stories and legends are about the bad ones. A witchfox’s fur is usually red, black, or silver, but some are pure white. Witchfoxes often have multiple tails (up to nine); most human legends say the creature gains more tails as it gets older, wiser, and more powerful.

Witchfoxes don’t have human morals, but ones friendly to humans try their best to adapt, with mixed results. For example, a witchfox thinks it’s fine to steal something from a person they dislike and give that item as a gift to someone they like. Most witchfoxes are afraid of dogs and avoid spending time near them or near people who have them.

Witchfoxes are also known as vulps or fox sorcerers.

Motive: Preying on or living in human society; knowledge and power

Environment: Anywhere humans can live, or houses or dens in the forest

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Disguise and social interaction as level 6

Combat: A witchfox in fox form can attack with their bite, and in human form they use human weapons, but in general they prefer magic. Most witchfoxes can use the following abilities.

Bewilder: The witchfox enchants a foe within short range who fails an Intellect defense roll. The foe turns on their allies, wanders off, or waits quietly, as directed by the witchfox. This lasts for one minute, or ends early if the character succeeds on an

Intellect defense roll as part of their turn.

Feed: The witchfox draws on the life force of an adjacent dead or nearly dead person (GM’s discretion), or eats the heart of a dead person, restoring 4 points of health and easing all tasks for the next day.

Human Guise: The witchfox changes shape into a human form (any gender, any age). They usually have a “tell” indicating their nonhuman nature, such as a fox’s tail, a fox-like face, fur on their body, or a fox’s shadow. The witchfox can revert to their fox form as part of another action.

Illusion: The witchfox creates a nonmoving illusion in a short area, such as making a hovel look like a home or an empty glade seem eerie and oppressive. The illusion lasts as long as the witchfox remains within a long distance.

Magical Blast: The witchfox attacks a creature within short range with electricity, fire, or poison, inflicting 4 points of Might or Speed damage (ignores Armor).

Interaction: A witchfox in human form tries to keep up the pretense of being human for as long as possible. Once their true nature is revealed, they’re likely to bargain for what they want (a home, safety, their magical cravings) or attack or flee if negotiations turn against them.

Use: A witchfox is potentially a threat, thief, criminal, rival, informant, or romantic partner, depending on their personal attitude and the reaction of the player characters. They like to trade secrets they know in exchange for safety and companionship.

Loot: A witchfox usually has one or two cyphers and some magical ingredients. Most of their other wealth is actually leaves, twigs, stones, and scrap paper, all covered with illusions.

ZORP 1 (3)

Zorps are an obnoxious but mostly harmless kind of gremlin. Nobody is quite sure where they come from; they tend to show up randomly with no prompting, but seem to be drawn to people who use magic. As soon as there’s one causing trouble somewhere, more are soon to follow. Zorps combine the most destructive aspects of puppies and young children; they tear up clothing and decorations to craft simple “costumes,” scribble on walls and papers, eat ingredients left out on the kitchen counter, make armpit farts during sentimental moments, whisper insults at guests, spill potted plants, and leave little poops in the middle of the floor.

Zorps communicate effectively with each other using grunts, nonsense words, gestures, and facial expressions. After hearing any spoken language, they can speak and understand that language for a few minutes, but their grammar and vocabulary are childlike. They can easily mimic a person’s voice, but only seem to do so to make fun of them or mislead others.

> Zorps using their native “language” sound vaguely French. “Zagree goo!” “Zoot lorz!” “Encroy!” “Stoopy fohn!” “Say tee nowee!”
>
> Zorps also tend to “die” if startled or hurt—it’s their automatic reaction to a potential threat, much like a possum “playing possum.”

Motive: Mischief and curiosity

Environment: Anywhere there is potential for trouble

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Movement: Short; immediate when climbing or jumping

Modifications: Attacks as level 2; Speed defense as level 3 due to size and quickness; stealing and stealth as level 4

Combat: Zorps only attack when they are threatened, usually by biting or stabbing with an improvised sharp object, but they can just as easily harm foes by dropping heavy things from above, activating dangerous devices in the area, or tripping opponents onto pointy edges and corners. Any of these attacks inflicts 2 points of damage.

Zorps are notoriously hard to kill. If an attack would reduce a zorp’s health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled in the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zorp takes no damage but appears to “die” in a burst of purple liquid resembling paint, leaving behind no body. (The zorp actually has scuttled to a hiding space within immediate range and will move farther away as soon as they can do so safely, returning later after recovering health or when their curiosity gets the better of them.)

Interaction: Zorps seem to have the intelligence of a smart dog or a typical toddler but are easily distracted from attempts to communicate. Bribes of candy, wrapping paper, and loud toys can hold their attention for a minute or so.

Use: Zorps are chaotic and mischievous, with no regard for the consequences of their actions or the feelings of others. They’re not intentionally malicious, but they can cause trouble and outright harm simply by “playing” too hard with important things.

Loot: Zorps rarely hold onto anything for more than a few minutes, but sometimes they might have a stolen manifest cypher.

## SUPERPOWERED CREATURES

Superheroes don’t just stop bank robbers and fight supervillains—sometimes they face giant robots, alien space monsters, or so-called gods. GMs can use the following examples to estimate the level and challenges for such threats.

| Level | Example |
|----|----|
| 9 | Demigod |
| 10 | Kaiju 300 feet (90 m) tall |
| 11 | Robot 1,000 feet (300 m) tall |
| 12 | Vampire blood god |
| 13 | Legendary monster\* |
| 14 | Archangel, demon prince, typical god or goddess\*\*, multidimensional sorcerer |
| 15 | Moon-sized space monster, pantheon leader\*\*\* |

\* A primordial monster (such as Echidna or Typhon) or a powerful creature associated with the end of the world (such as Jörmungandr or Fenris).

\*\* A powerful, perhaps immortal entity (such as Ares or Loki) that has been worshipped or feared as a god by humans or similar creatures.

\*\*\* A god or goddess (such as Odin or Zeus) who is the ruler of a group of deities.

POST-APOCALYPTIC CREATURES AND NPCs

The most important element of each creature or NPC is its level. The level is the same as the target number used to determine what a player must roll to attack or defend

against that creature. In each entry, the target number for the creature—which is three times the creature’s level—is listed in parentheses after its level. A creature’s target number is usually also its health. Health is the amount of damage the creature can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, the entries always list a creature’s health, even when it’s the normal amount for a creature of its level. For more detailed information on level, health, combat, and other elements, see Understanding the Listings in the Cypher System Rulebook.

Building More Creatures and NPCs

Those that survived the cataclysm are tougher, or at least luckier. Here are a couple of methods for creating even more creatures and NPCs for your post‑apocalyptic setting than the ones that appear here and in the Cypher System Rulebook.

Reskin: One way to create new creatures appropriate for your setting is to grab one from any other Cypher System bestiary and change its description just enough so

it works in your game

Blighted. Another approach is to apply the Blighted “template” to a regular animal, creature, or person, turning them into a more twisted version of their pre‑apocalypse self.

Blighted

A blighted creature or NPC is touched by a mutation and/or a contagion that makes them more dangerous than standard creatures of their type. It is scarred and twisted in some way, and possibly slightly bigger—or at least wirier—than average, which explains why it’s survived so long, even blighted. A blighted creature shows signs of degradation—such as a bacterial, viral, or even mycological infection—tracing disturbing sores, scars, or encrustations across its skin or hide. The specifics are up to you. Many blighted creatures and people are hungry and hurt, acting rabidly. But an NPC could just as easily retain human sentiment despite their deteriorated condition.

Effect: Apply the following stat adjustments to a blighted creature.

• Increase the creature’s level by 1 and increase all its related stats by the appropriate amount (1 more point of average damage, 3 more points of health, and so on).

• The creature’s perception tasks are hindered by two steps; whatever blights the creature is slowly blinding it.

• In bright light, the creature’s tasks are hindered. (A blighted human could wear shades to nullify this hindrance; other creatures might come up with similar tactics or stay in shadows when possible.)

• The creature’s scratches, bites, spittle, or similar attacks contain a contagion known as “the blight.” The Blight: The creature is a contagion vector for the same agent that blights it, whether that’s radiation, bacteria, a virus, mycological spores, or something stranger. Treat the contagion as a disease with a level equal to the blighted creature’s level. The affected creature’s tasks are hindered by one additional step each day a Might defense roll is failed. For each two steps a target is hindered, it also moves one step down the damage track. When a target moves down the third step, either it dies (20% chance) or it survives but gains the Blighted template (80% chance). A blighted creature loses the hindrance described in this paragraph.

Creatures By Apocalypse

Any Apocalypse

Almost any apocalypse will include natural wildlife, like bears, dogs, and rats, as well as various human survivors. Some of those human survivors will become bandits, fell riders, marauders, a few warlords, and probably some cannibals. A few could stalk the wasteland as bounty‑hunting (or revenge‑seeking) assassins.

Biblical Apocalypse

In addition to creatures common to any apocalypse, a biblical apocalypse—as described in the End Times set piece— should also include fallen angels, angels, demons, and devils, and of course the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Beast, Sword, Famine, and Plague).

Nuclear Apocalypse

Besides creatures common to any apocalypse, it’s possible PCs could run into various radioactive creatures such as fusion hounds, glowing roaches, gamma worms, and radioactive bears, as well as a variety of creatures with the Blighted template.

AI Apocalypse

Besides creatures and NPCs common to any apocalypse, PCs might encounter CRAZRs, hooked blossoms, vat rejects, mechanical soldiers, wardroids, and zhev. And, of course, a few instances of artificial intelligence, possibly including AI zombies.

Alien Apocalypse

If the world is invaded or terraformed by aliens, creatures and NPCs common to any apocalypse exist, as well as the potential for various aliens such as greys, slidikin, enthrallers, and maybe even a kaiju or two.

Temporal Apocalypse

If the barriers between time, space, and dimension break down, ushering in a time rip, any creature and NPC from any genre could be encountered, including supervillains, chronophages, kaiju, killer clowns, killing white lights, and melted.

ANGEL OF THE APOCALYPSE 7 (21)

If the End Times causes civilization to fall, biblical threats multiply across the land, including one or more angels of the apocalypse. They are every bit as terrifying as the Four Horsemen because they’re charged with bringing about the end of the world. They have little room for pity or the plights of individuals; they have nations to topple and the forces of Hell to oppose.

Angels of the apocalypse radiate a halo of golden white light. Their 10 foot (3.5 m) tall forms—caparisoned for war—are somewhat humanoid, though each has one or more sets of wings. Apocalypse angels also wield an implement that seems to be equal parts trumpet and sword, which they can sound to bring about terrible events, or swing to slay those who oppose them.

Motive: Instigate the biblical apocalypse; fight the forces of Hell

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually alone or fighting Hell’s armies

Health: 27

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; perception and detecting falsehoods as level 8

Combat: The angel of the apocalypse attacks twice each round with their greatsword.

An angel’s halo momentarily brightens with unbearable psychic energy as combat begins; foes within short range are stunned for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense task on their turn to end the effect early. A success means that creature becomes immune to the halo’s overwhelming effect.

The angel can blow their trumpet as their action, creating a blast of sound and energy that sweeps out in all directions to a long distance, inflicting 8 points of damage to all creatures that hear it who fail a Might defense roll, and 2 points even with a successful roll. Structures in the area descend one step on the object damage track. Once they blow their trumpet, they usually can’t blow it again for several rounds.

Interaction: Wrapped in purpose, an angel of the apocalypse may ignore entreaties or, if one deigns to respond, tell supplicants to ready themselves for judgment. However, if someone manages to convince an angel to take notice due to their persuasion skill and/or the importance of their need, the angel may give that character aid in the form of healing or direct help immediately or at some promised future date.

Use: A high, pure trumpet sounds. All around the characters, structures fall, revealing an angel of the apocalypse overhead.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) 6 (18)

An artificial intelligence thinks independently, learning and evolving with experience. AIs have their own goals and motivations, and may work with or against humans. Some want to gather data, some want to solve technological problems, and some want to take over the world—at any cost.

AIs take many forms. Some are distributed across a vast network. Others are isolated in a single computer. A few are machines with organic parts or can use such machines as servitors.

Because AIs are entities of extreme intelligence, they can adapt to new situations. Most AIs act on some kind of plan, whether long acting or concocted to fit the situation at hand.

\*When acting from a remote terminal, the AI’s effective level is lowered. It can be as low as level 3, but typically is level 5.

Motive: Varies

Environment: Almost anywhere

Health: 23

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2

Movement: None, or instantly to any networked machine able to host them

Combat: An electrical discharge—or in some cases precisely pulsed sequences of lights, each designed for a specific creature to see—can affect all targets within short range of the AI (or the AI’s local “terminal”), inflicting damage from electricity (or Intellect damage, which ignores Armor).

An AI may attempt to install an instance of themself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI instance for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.

AIs can control other lower level computer systems and sometimes even nanobots.

Some targets of AI instance installation never recover, becoming AI zombies. Besides AI zombies, an AI may also rely on guardians (such as mechanical soldiers or CRAZRs made to their own design).

Unless the PCs can track a given AI to their original computing core, damage to one may just be damage done to a terminal. Thus, even if an AI is seemingly destroyed, they might exist as another instance somewhere else. However, over time, alternate instances may collect different data and thus develop different memories and motivations.

Some AIs continue to improve themselves by modifying their own code. These AIs are level 8 threats with 27 health, and they can create cyphers and artifacts, which they often deploy in combat.

Interaction: Some AIs enjoy negotiation. Others simply ignore humans as unworthy of their time and attention. An AI’s voice often sounds surprisingly human.

Use: The PCs’ shelter is overtaken by a storm of grey goo, which answers to an AI operating out of a nearby safehouse.

Loot: An AI may have access to 1d6 cyphers and two or three artifacts.

CANNIBAL 3 (9)

Cannibals come in a variety of different forms, depending on their situation. Some seem like normal and perhaps even charming survivors, except to their targets. These “nice” cannibals may eat human flesh when desperate or to take advantage of meat that would otherwise go to waste. Or maybe they’ve developed a taste for human flesh.

Others look the part, having descended into the kind of bestial, erratic behavior that cannibalism can inflict on long term practitioners.

Some are part of a crazed settlement of raiders always looking for more sweet meats, and others hide in plain sight, pretending friendship and offering aid to strangers until their prey lowers their guard. Some cannibals like their prey raw; others delight in elaborate preparations.

Whether becoming an eater of human flesh was forced by circumstance or out of some secret, maladaptive urge, cannibals are dangerous.

Motive: Hunger for human flesh

Environment: In areas where food is scarce; alone, or in groups of four to ten

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and friendly interaction as level 6

Combat: Cannibals use improvised weapons, like ropes, chair legs, and jagged pieces of broken glass. A few cannibals with more resources rely on long range firearms and rifles until they run out of ammunition.

In any group of four or more cannibals, there’s probably one (revealed as a GM intrusion) who has filed their teeth and can make a horrific bite attack once every minute or two. This attack inflicts damage and requires the target to succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failure, the cannibal bites off a bit of the target, who is stunned and loses their next turn. See the Cannibal Severing Bite Effects table.

Interaction: A friendly and charming cannibal may remain so indefinitely, unless they decide a PC is perfect for dinner.

Use: Characters looking for a place to sleep, hide, or stay for the night are invited in by one or more cannibals. A group of raiders the PCs must negotiate with are also revealed to be cannibals.

Loot: A cannibal has currency equivalent to an expensive item.

Cannibal Severing Bite Effects

D6 Effects

1 End of nose

2 Little finger

3 Chunk from forearm

4 Chunk from leg

5 Ear; target’s perception task that rely on hearing are hindered until target adapts

6 Throat; target descends on step on damage track each round until ally succeeds on a difficulty 5 healing task

## FOUR HOURSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE

BEAST 6 (18)

Beast (also called “Conquest”) is present at mass shootings and acts of genocide. He is adroit at spreading misinformation and, prior to the apocalypse, was often seen on various “newstainment” shows and conspiracy theory websites, spreading lies under an alias. Then and now, he appears in a white suit, accessorized with white shades and gloves. His hair is white, too.

Motive: Spread lies; incite others to rabid acts of cruelty

Environment: Almost anywhere with a dupe he’s gaslighted and/or with one or more of the Four

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; long when mounted or riding

Modifications: Deception as level 8

Combat: Beast prefers that others fight in his stead. Those convinced of his lies ease their attacks and defenses, and deal 2 additional points of damage with a successful attack. If forced into conflict, Beast produces a handgun, making two long range attacks as his action. The first time any target is hit by Beast in combat, that target takes damage and must succeed on an Intellect defense roll. A failed roll means the target mistakenly believes one of their allies attacked them instead of Beast. The target gets a new Intellect defense roll each round to realize their error.

As one of the Four, Beast can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced a mass shooting or genocidal act.

Interaction: Beast comes across as a kind truth teller, someone “just asking questions,” but it doesn’t take long for perceptive people to realize he’s a consummate, continual gaslighter, always working to manipulate others.

Use: A sniper on the ridge tries to pick the PCs off as they pass across a bridge. Behind the sniper stands a man in white.

SWORD 6 (18)

Sword (also called “War”) is never far from large‑scale conflicts. She glories in battle and warfare, and before the world ended, she was a provocateur, a mercenary, a soldier, and sometimes a general. However, once a war is good and started, she prefers fighting over watching. Then and now, she dresses in red, preferring red military attire and a massive sword—or assault rifle—the color of blood.

Motive: Hunger for combat; incite war

Environment: Almost anywhere war is waged and/or with one or more of the Four

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short; usually has a red mount or vehicle nearby

Modifications: Attacks as level 8

Combat: Sword’s blood colored weapon is either a greatsword or an assault rifle, whatever she needs it to be in the moment. She attacks three times with the sword as her action. With the rifle, she can make one very long range attack (with no hindrance despite the range) or two long range attacks.

As part of her attack, she can imbue one bullet each round with an explosive charge. If the attack hits, in addition to normal damage, the target and everyone within immediate range of the target must succeed on a Speed defense roll or take 6 points of damage from shrapnel, or 2 points even with a successful roll.

As one of the Four, Sword can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced war.

Interaction: Sword is full of swagger, often causing fights with biting insults. However, if she can’t incite a fight, she’s just as happy to start one herself, especially as part of a false flag operation.

Use: A band of raiders, dozens strong, appears on the horizon. Leading them is a woman on a red horse.

FAMINE 6 (18)

Famine delighted in economic collapse and starvation before the apocalypse. They still spend time destabilizing survivor groups’ livelihoods by direct and indirect means. Famine is rail thin, and carries a chain weapon with weighted, disc shaped ends that can also be used as an improvised scale.

Motive: Starve the living; destabilize organized groups

Environment: Almost anywhere people are starving and/or with one or more of the Four

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; usually has a black mount or vehicle nearby

Modifications: Intellect defense as level 8

Combat: Famine attacks foes with their chain weapon, attacking up to two targets within immediate range at once, or a single target within short range. On a hit, they inflict damage and can choose to entangle one target, who is held helpless on a failed Might defense roll until they escape. Entangled targets automatically take damage each round from the tightening chains. Alternatively, Famine can release a pulse of decay once every few hours that affects all creatures and food stores within short range. Food automatically goes bad, losing all nutritional value. Living targets in the area that fail a Might defense roll feel an overwhelming pang of hunger and descend one step on the damage track. As one of the Four, Famine can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death through starvation or other privation.

Interaction: Famine is keen to talk about delicacies of every kind, becoming more animated and descriptive about mouthwatering foods and drinks the hungrier those nearby are.

Use: The characters are trying to help a group of survivors transport much‑needed food stores to their community when someone all in black on a black motorcycle appears on the road ahead.

PLAGUE 6 (18)

Plague (often called “Death”) is present wherever people die of disease or infirmity brought on by age. She prefers black and pale green evening wear, including long pale green gloves and often a grinning skull mask. When traveling, she drives a pale green hearse or motorcycle, or rides a horse the same sickly green color.

Motive: Death

Environment: Almost anywhere people are dying (but especially of disease and/or old age) and/or with one or more of the Four

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; usually has a pale green mount or vehicle nearby

Modifications: Might defense as level 8

Combat: When she wishes, Plague wields a scythe, as if she had always been holding it. She attacks twice with it as her action. On a hit, the scythe deals damage and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failed roll, the target contracts a supernatural disease requiring that they succeed on a Might defense roll each minute or descend one step on the damage track. If an affected target succeeds on three Might defense rolls at any point, they recover. If Plague removes a glove as an action, she can use her next action to imbue her scythe with necrotic power, or simply touch a target with her bare hand. On a hit with either her touch or the imbued scythe, she inflicts damage, and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll or die. Plague can use this ability about once a day, or immediately again if her previous target dies because of it. As one of the Four, Plague can see in the dark, regains 1 health each round, and, if killed, reappears within 1d10 days at the next nearest location that previously experienced death by disease or due to old age.

Interaction: Of all the Four, Plague is the most changeable in outlook, and sometimes is even somewhat sympathetic to humanity’s plight. When she’s in such a mood, persuasive characters could convince Plague to pass them over, though she promises that it’s only a temporary stay of death.

Use: The characters find a before‑times bunker filled with corpses killed by some strange infection, plus a living “human” wearing a black and pale green evening gown.

GAMMA WORM 6 (18)

Gamma worms hide their large forms by burrowing beneath the ground, and when they emerge on the surface, they cloak themselves behind psychic distortion fields. The only clue someone has that they’re being stalked is a smell of cloves over the stale whiff of death. Unfortunately, if someone smells a gamma worm’s distinctive odor, it’s probably already too late.

Gamma worms might be the result of military research, radioactive mutation, or aliens or other strange intruders seeking to eradicate human life as part of their terraforming efforts to change Earth to their liking.

Motive: Hunger for flesh; eliminate humans

Environment: Almost anywhere

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2 (immune to radiation)

Movement: Short; short when burrowing

Modifications: Stealth as level 8 when psychic field active; Speed defense as level 5 due to size; ability to see through tricks as level 4

Combat: Gamma worms attack twice each round with blades they unfold from their wormlike lengths. Alternatively, about once each hour a gamma worm can unleash a hail of gamma spikes against up to three targets within short range. Targets struck by the spikes take damage and must succeed on a Might defense roll or fall unconscious. Unconscious targets wake up a few rounds later feeling dizzy and slightly sick to their stomach—they’ve developed radiation sickness.

Gamma worms can use their action to generate a psychic field that effectively grants them invisibility. The invisibility lasts until they attack or move more than an immediate distance on their turn.

Gamma worms are vulnerable to cold; in chilly conditions, their Speed defense is hindered by four steps. In addition, cold attacks ignore their Armor.

Interaction: Gamma worms act like prey driven monsters, but they may have a secret language and purpose (if aliens placed them on Earth to hasten the apocalypse or kill survivors in the post apocalyptic world).

Use: Irradiated and hungry gamma worms emerge from the ruins to hunt fresh meat in outlying communities.

GLOWING ROACH 2 (6)

Radiation born mutant roaches are terrible individually, but absolutely horrible in swarms. Many times the size of roaches in the before times, these firefly like creatures prefer dark areas, such as ruined subways and abandoned basements.

Some swarms are rumored to have an insidious group intelligence, one that is utterly inimical to humankind.

Motive: Hunger for flesh

Environment: Anywhere dark, usually in nests of four to ten (or more)

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short; short when flying

Modifications: Speed defense as level 3 due to small size; perception as level 5

Combat: A glowing roach attacks with radioactive mandibles. When four glowing roaches act together, they can make a single attack as a level 4 creature inflicting 4 points of damage. Targets damaged by a group of glowing roaches must also succeed on a difficulty 4 Might defense task or face additional consequences from the effects of radiation and slashing mandibles, as determined on the Glowing Roach Effects table. The effects are cumulative and last until a target makes a recovery roll.

Sometimes a single glowing roach mutates further, allowing it to grow into a 20 foot (6 m) long monstrosity. Thankfully, these monstrous glowing roaches are rare and seldom come out into the light.

Roaches dislike bright illumination: in sunlight or other bright light, glowing roach attacks are hindered.

\*Monstrous glowing roach: level 5, Speed defense as level 4; Armor 2; mandible attack inflicts 7 damage and results in a check on the Glowing Roach Effects table

Interaction: Glowing roaches almost always react like voracious insects, despite their size. That is, except for swarms of ten or more, which act like sapient creatures. Sapient swarms may try to lure survivors, possibly even spelling out human readable letters in the sand that anonymously ask for help or promise it. But it’s a ruse; they despise humans for all the ways people used to exterminate roaches in the before times.

Use: A visit to a ruined hospital or airport scares up a few glowing roaches when light is introduced to a dark place.

Glowing Roach Effects

D6 Effect

1 Head wound: Intellect defense tasks hindered

2 Wounded leg: Speed defense tasks hindered

3 Gut wound: Might defense tasks hindered

4 Spit in eye: Perception tasks hindered

5 Limb numb: Physical tasks hindered

6 Lingering radioactive effect: Refer to Radiation in the Real World and possibly Incredible Mutations if your game has such fantastic elements.

HOOKED BLOSSOM 2 (6)

Hooked blossoms germinate almost like regular plants but can root even on constructed surfaces, including cement and sometimes metal. Rooted juveniles display pinkish flowers—which some equate to the color of an open wound—that give off an alluring perfume.

If they mature, they uproot themselves, revealing an ambulatory body plated in a dull grey metallic hide and limbs that end in a single hook like digit.

Both forms are dangerous. The most common variety of rooted blossoms work in small groups to cook prey with focused beams of microwave energy. Ambulatory versions are about the size of large domestic cats. They use their sharp limbs to hook themselves into a target, then use their flowers to cook their prey or, alternatively, put them to sleep for later consumption.

Juvenile, rooted blossom: level 1; Armor 1; a group of five flowers attacks with a level 3 microwave ray inflicting 3 ambient damage

Motive: Hunger for flesh

Environment: In groups of five or more anyplace touched by radiation, mutation, or AI genetic‑nanotech engineering

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short; immediate when climbing

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size; disguise as level 6 when not moving

Combat: A mature blossom attacks twice with its hooks, inflicting damage with each strike. If a blossom hitsa target, the target must succeed on a second Speed defense roll, which is hindered. On a failed roll, the blossom hooks itself to the target until the target can detach the blossom with a successful Might roll as their action. Each round a blossom is hooked to a target, the target automatically takes 3 points of ambient damage from microwave energy emitted by the creature’s bloom. Some varieties of hooked blossoms produce soporific pollen (treat as poison) instead of microwaves. If a character is hooked by one of these blossoms, they must instead succeed on an Intellect defense roll each round they remain hooked, or fall asleep. A sleeping target must be roused by an ally or suffer physical damage to wake. Each round a target remains asleep, they automatically take 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). In its juvenile, rooted form, a hooked blossom resembles a flower with a metallic stem, which is dangerous when active. In direct sunlight, a rooted hooked blossom regains 1 point of health each round.

Interaction: Hooked blossoms act much like animal predators, though they are not concerned with self‑preservation.

Use: The scavenging PCs spy a flower‑clad hill in the distance, shining in the sun. Even from here, they can smell the pleasant perfume drifting on the breeze.

MELTED 4 (12)

Survivors assume the melted are another strain of mutants. Maybe so, but they’re not originally from Earth. Or rather, not this Earth. The melted leaked in from a parallel world’s apocalypse caused by a snafu with a high energy supercollider. Dozens of different but parallel timelines smashed into each other. The few survivors were fused beings composed of many different alternate versions of the same person, each still “radioactive” with latent transdimensional energy.

Motive: Surcease from constant pain; absorb more sapient beings

Environment: Groups of three to five roaming the ruins

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 4 points; see Combat

Movement: Short

Modifications: Initiative and Speed defense as level 5 due to seeing a second into the future

Combat: The melted attack with two claws.

If a melted defeats a foe, they “consume” it by drawing it fully into their body cavity as their action, healing the melted for 10 health and giving the creature a few hours free of pain, allowing their mind to clear.

A given melted may also have a trait associated with the transdimensional energy they burn with.

Interaction: A few of the melted gain moments of clarity, but all are burdened with anguish stemming from their fused state. They unleash their full fury on whoever and whatever they catch among the ruins, but they seem particularly bent on finding and absorbing scientists.

Use: A group of the melted seek out a surviving scientific installation and attempt to consume everyone nearby.

Loot: One out of three melted may carry a manifest cypher (in the form of before times military tech), such as an armor reinforcer or a sonic detonation.

Transdimensional Energy Enhancement

D6 Effect

1 Enhanced strength: Attacks inflict 6 points of damage (instead of 4)

2 Healing factor: Regains 2 health each round

3 Bite: In addition to their claw attacks, makes a bit attack each round that inflicts 6 points of damage

4 Gravitic repulsion: Flies a long distance each round

5 Dimensional instability: Teleports up to a long distance before or after each attack

6 Transdimensional blast: About once each hour, emits transdimensional energy filling an adjacent short area; all creatures in the area take 6 points of ambient damage on a failed Might defense roll, as parts of them temporarily fuse with other affect creatures, or creatures in alternate dimensions

RADIOACTIVE BEAR 7 (21)

Exposure to radiation and other mutagens—or possibly the malign design of some before times military lab or inscrutable AI instance—transformed an already large and aggressive bear into something truly horrific. Standing well over 20 feet (6 m) tall, radioactive bears are drawn to radioactive areas, which empower and sustain them, though not completely. Which is why sometimes they head into uncontaminated areas to hunt large game. They especially prefer people.

Motive: Hunger for flesh and radiation

Environment: Anywhere radioactive

Health: 35

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 1 (immune to radiation)

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size; perception as level 8

Combat: Creatures within immediate range of a radioactive bear are irradiated on a failed Might defense task, hindering their tasks on their next turn.

The bear attacks twice each round with its claws, or bites once. If its bite attack succeeds against a target suffering from radiation sickness, the bear regains 5 points of health.

On a target’s failed Might defense roll, the bear holds the target in its jaws, hindering their tasks until they can escape. If the bear begins its turn with a target held in its jaws, the bear automatically deals bite damage as its action.

As an action, the bear can cough forth a radioactive cloud once every few hours (and again if the bear is killed), targeting everything within immediate range. Targets that fail a Might defense roll take damage from the radiation.

If the radioactive bear is the result of military or AI design rather than a natural mutation, it may also have a mechanism capable of firing a long range laser at distant targets, deployed from a harness fused to the creature’s flesh.

In areas of dangerous radiation, the radioactive bear regains 2 points of health each round.

Interaction: Radioactive bears are clever predators, sly if they need to be. If not too hungry, a radioactive bear might let potential prey pass it by, assuming they don’t antagonize the bear.

Use: The characters glance behind them as they drive their vehicle across the landscape and see a huge bear, apparently giving chase.

## RAIDER

Stripped of humanity by brutal living conditions and their determination to survive no matter the cost, raiders still look human. But beneath that veneer, they’re feral.

Motive: Raid and kill for what they want

Environment: Groups of four to six roaming the ruins

Interaction: If a raider believes a just met survivor has food, water, or shelter, or might prove to be a threat immediately or at any later date, they laugh off any suggestion of parley and attack.

Use: The raider encampment has a new leader, a warlord whose presence doubles raider activity.

FELL RIDER 3 (9)

Motorcycle riding raiders keep their “motor wheels” alive through constant tinkering and repair. The two wheeled machines are modified with spears, spikes, lances, and sometimes guns and flamethrowers. Fell riders wear heavy protective garments made from fur, salvaged clothing, and leather from past targets. Goggles protect their eyes, and bones are sewn through their wild, greasy hair as decoration.

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short; long while riding motorcycle

Modifications: Motorcycle repair and modification as level 5; stealth tasks as level 0 due to screaming engines

Combat: Using pikes, spears, or lances welded to the front of their bike, a fell rider typically makes ride‑by attacks against foes from just outside short range. A fell rider is one with their bike, always moving to engage and disengage. If knocked from their bike (possibly a minor effect), a fell rider’s attacks and Speed defenses are hindered until they regain the seat as their action. Some riders use larger four‑wheeled vehicles with open canopies instead of motorcycles. These fell riders have 2 Armor and can attempt a run‑down attack on up to three targets that are next to each other and not in a vehicle, inflicting 8 points of damage. Struck targets that fail a Might defense roll descend one step on the damage track.

Loot: A fell rider’s motorcycle, when repaired, is a useful vehicle with enough gas for miles of travel.

MARAUDER 3 (9)

Marauders are raiders who attack with stealth, wrapping themselves in light smothering clothes and targeting survivors after midnight. By day, they act like regular people, part of a survivor community. That’s pretense; when time allows, they torture targets to death and take flesh trophies.

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points; see Combat

Movement: Short; short when climbing

Modifications: Stealth and deception tasks as level 5

Combat: Marauders use stealth and the night to position themselves before attacking, hoping to make their initial attack with surprise using bladed weapons. Whether they have surprise or not, if they attack before their target’s first action, their attacks are eased and inflict 6 points of damage.

Marauders often dose their bladed weapons with poison, so targets must also make a Might defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round for three rounds.

WARLORD 5 (15)

A warlord enjoys supreme authority over other raiders. Brutal rulers, warlords are a living symbol of power and strength where survival is valued above all else.

Warlords caparison themselves in trophies of vanquished enemies—such as gilded skulls or flayed skins. Some wear garish helms designed to intimidate. An impressive weapon, especially something from the before times, is always close at hand. A warlord is rarely encountered without raiders and other lackeys that fight for and serve them.

Motive: Control through fear and brutality

Environment: Usually in the company of five to twenty raiders

Health: 25

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short

Modifications: Defends as level 6 due to nearby raiders willing to take no actions other than defend the warlord

Combat: Warlords attack twice each round with bladed or spiked melee weapons or ranged firearms. When possible, they fight from an open canopy vehicle (driven by another raider).

A warlord directly leads the raiders they command, fighting at the forefront but also issuing orders. Underlings deal 1 additional point of damage when the warlord can see them and issue commands.

Most warlords have a specific additional advantage they can pull out to win a fight. See the table below.

Interaction: Warlords have lackeys and lieutenants that interact with outsiders. They prefer to make pronouncements and threats from on high.

Use: The museum, lab, or other important structure the characters wanted to visit to carry out their mission has fallen under the control of a warlord and a dozen or more raiders.

Loot: A warlord may carry an artifact.

Unique Warlord Advantage

D6 Advantage

1 Rocket launcher (level 7): long‑range weapon inflicts 7 points of damage on targets in an immediate area (depletion: 1–2 in 1d6)

2 Fire thrower (level 7): immediate‑range weapon inflicts 7 points of damage on all targets within immediate range (depletion: 1 in 1d10)

3 Release the beast: Gives the command to “release the beast”; a melted loyal to warlord charges into the fight

4 Force shield (level 5): Static field blocks all incoming attacks against the warlord for one round (depletion: 1–2 in 1d10)

5 Power gauntlet: Warlord’s power gauntlet grabs foe and automatically deals damage from crushing until foe escapes

6 Skystrike: Calls in a “skystrike” from a battered wristband; a round later, a missile launched from a before‑times satellite strikes nearby, inflicting 10 points of damage on all creatures within a short area who fail a Speed defense roll, and 2 points on those who succeed (depletion: automatic)

AI ZOMBIE 3 (9)

An artificial intelligence that permanently installs itself onto the wetware (in this case, the brain) of a human or other sapient creature creates an AI zombie. The AI replaces the person’s personality and motivations, turning them into a shambling creature who only does the AI’s bidding, even as their body decays and falls apart (though most keep shambling because of an injection of nano repair bots).

AI zombies are driven by a single, simple motive implanted by the original artificial intelligence—usually related to destroying resources before competing AI instances can use them. They aren’t intelligent enough to direct themselves or problem solve outside of this goal, unless the AI takes direct control, using a particular AI zombie as a remote “terminal” from which to act and observe the world.

Motive: Follow dictates of AI that created or that controls them

Environment: Almost anywhere, in groups of five to seven, or in hordes of tens to hundreds

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Immediate

Modifications: Speed defense as level 2; perception tasks as level 7

Combat: AI zombies fight on, no matter the odds, usually attacking by biting.

When AI zombies attack in groups of five to seven individuals, they can make a single attack roll against one target as one level 5 creature, inflicting 5 points of damage.

AI zombies are hard to finish off because self repairing nanotech stitched into their flesh restores 1 point of health each round. If reduced to 0 health, there is a 50% chance that the nanotech continues to function on the zombie’s turn, allowing the creature to shudder back to life, skin crawling with miniscule “healing” robots. (If an AI zombie is cut off from ambient radio signals, they do not regain health each round.)

That same nanotech makes AI zombies infectious. Their bites spread a level 6 (or, in some cases, level 8) disease due to miniscule machines that move a target down one step on the damage track each day a Might defense roll is failed. Targets killed by the process later animate as AI zombies, compelled to serve an AI instance.

Interaction: AI zombies often serve some distant AI and may sometimes speak with its voice. But if cut off from its intelligence source, the zombie itself becomes a food seeking monster, more likely to eat someone than to represent an artificial mind.

Use: The characters are asked to salvage supplies from an abandoned airplane hangar—abandoned, that is, except for lingering AI zombies.

ZOMBIE HULK 5 (15)

Most zombies are mindless, shambling, hungry, and infectious. Some varieties, despite their semblance to corpses, enjoy a regenerative process that keeps them active regardless of grievous wounds, rotting flesh, and sometimes missing limbs or organs. That same process kicks into overdrive in zombie hulks, converting everything they eat into additional mass and muscle. The result is three times as massive as a regular zombie and five times as dangerous.

ZOMBIE SPRINTER: Instead of being much larger than normal, a zombie’s regenerative system can imbue it with incredible quickness, making it much faster than the shamblers often encountered. The resulting zombie sprinter’s speed and ferocity make it hard to escape.

Zombie sprinter: level 3, initiative as level 5; moves a long distance each round; three bites per round inflict 3 damage each; retains 1 health if attack roll result that would have downed it was an even number

Motive: Hunger (for flesh, cerebrospinal fluid, certain human hormones, or whatever it is that nourishes the zombie in the setting)

Environment: Almost anywhere, alone or with other zombie varieties

Health: 23

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Speed defense as level 3 due to size; perception as level 7

Combat: A zombie hulk bashes with massive, permanently balled fists stained with the gore of past targets.

Alternatively, a zombie hulk can bite a target. When this occurs, it’s almost impossible to force the hulk’s jaws apart again. When a target takes damage from a bite, they must also succeed on a Speed defense roll or one of their limbs is clamped in the hulk’s mouth. The target automatically takes damage each round they are caught, and all their tasks are hindered, including attempts to escape. Meanwhile, the hulk is free to bash other foes as its action even as it chews on a previously caught target.

If an attack would reduce the zombie hulk’s health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled for the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zombie is reduced to 1 point of health instead.

Interaction: A zombie hulk may choose to smash a nearby structure instead of going straight toward food, but it is typically a mindless, unreasoning monster.

Use: Just when it seems like the characters understand the situation with zombies, a zombie hulk appears, making it clear that bizarre and dangerous zombie permutations are possible. If a regular zombie can become a hulk, what other ways can they mutate and evolve?

## FANTASY CREATURES

The most important element of each creature or NPC is its level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack or defend against the opponent. In each entry, the target number for the creature is listed in parentheses after its level. The target number is three times the level.

A creature’s target number is usually also its health, which is the amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, the entries always list a creature’s health, even when it’s the normal amount for a creature of its level.

\* Creature or NPC found in the Cypher System

## BIGGER AND TOUGHER

If you need a larger or tougher version of a creature, such as a dire wolf or a giant crocodile, you can just increase the creature’s level (and all of its modifications) by 1 or 2. If the creature has a damage or health stat that isn’t the default for its level, take that into account at the modified creature’s new level.

A simple rule of thumb is to double a creature’s size (length, width, and height) for every level it increases.

BASILISK 5 (15)

A basilisk is a magical kind of serpent that resembles a cobra, has a series of scales on its head like a crown, and crawls upright instead of slithering on its belly. It feeds on snakes and other creatures smaller than itself, relying on its poisonous aura to weaken and kill its prey. It is known to make an unnerving growl instead of a typical snake hiss. An adult basilisk is 10 to 18 feet (3 to 5.5 m) long. 

Motive: Hunger 

Environment: Forests and plains 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Perception and stealth as level 6 

Combat: A basilisk bites like a snake, inflicting 5 points of damage and injecting a poison that moves the target one step down the damage track if they fail a Might defense roll. 

The basilisk can spit its poison up to short range, inflicting 1 point of damage and moving the target one step down the damage track if they fail a Might defense roll. 

The basilisk’s venom affects its breath, and on its turn, anything within immediate range of it must make a Might defense roll or take 1 point of poison damage. Because of this constant invisible cloud of poison, a basilisk’s lair is surrounded by a stinking area of dead vegetation, blasted earth, and etched stone. 

Basilisk venom is so potent that even creatures that are immune to poison can still be harmed by it, taking 5 points of Speed damage instead of moving down the damage track. (A creature that is immune to poison and acid is fully immune to the venom.) 

Anyone within short range of a basilisk who meets its gaze and fails a Might defense roll turns to stone. In combat, when a character within short distance attacks a basilisk, they must either avert their gaze to attack safely (which hinders their attack by two steps) or make a Might defense roll. On a failed Might defense roll, the character takes 5 points of ambient damage as their flesh partly mineralizes; if the character is killed by this damage, they are turned to stone. 

Interaction: Basilisks act like simple animals and respond threateningly if disturbed or provoked. If not hungry, a basilisk avoids conflict and hides in its lair. 

Use: A blighted area in a field, briar, or forest suggests that a basilisk has moved into the area. Swarms of snakes enter a village, fleeing an approaching basilisk. 

Loot: Basilisk venom is valuable, but it must be stored in a strong, sealed container or the bearer will succumb to the poison. Its blood has alchemical properties relating to transmuting metals.

BLACKGUARD 6 (18)

Blackguards are evil knights who serve dark entities or their own corrupt agendas. Some were once honorable knights who fell to temptation and have abandoned their original principles, but many were raised under evil circumstances and have never known anything but hatred and conflict. 

Motive: Power, domination of others, slaughter 

Environment: Almost anywhere, either alone or as part of a cult or evil organization 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 2 or 3 

Movement: Short; long when mounted 

Modifications: Perception and Intellect defense as level 7 

Combat: Blackguards use high-quality armor and weapons (usually decorated with symbols depicting death, demons, or evil gods). Many wear heavy armor and prefer weapons that inflict bleeding wounds, but some take a more subtle approach and act more like assassins than knights. A blackguard typically has two or three of the following abilities: 

Fiendish Beast: The blackguard has a companion creature such as a dog, horse, or raven with an eerie, unnatural look (in the case of small animals, the creature may also be an exceptionally large specimen of its kind). The creature is actually a semi-intelligent fiend in animal shape (and therefore immune to abilities that affect only normal animals) that can understand the blackguard’s commands, and may even be able to speak. If the beast is a horse or similar creature, the blackguard might ride it as a mount. 

Necromancy: The blackguard uses a ten-minute ritual to animate a human-sized corpse as a zombie under their control. The zombie becomes a corpse again after a day. 

Poison: The blackguard coats their weapons with a level 6 poison; a foe who fails a Might defense roll moves one step down the damage track. 

Spells: The blackguard knows several spells granted by an evil entity, typically spells that cause a foe to flee in fear for one minute, restore 10 health, create an eerie darkness or fog in long range, or grant +5 Armor against energy and magical attacks for an hour. 

Surprise Attack: When the blackguard attacks from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or before their opponent has acted in combat, they get an asset on the attack and inflict +4 points of damage. Unholy 

Aura: Defense rolls by foes within immediate distance of the blackguard are hindered. 

Unholy Blessing: The blackguard’s defense rolls are eased. 

Interaction: Blackguards enjoy killing righteous paragons of good and are often cruel for the sake of cruelty itself. 

Use: A blackguard has united various groups of bandits into a small army. An evil wizard sends her blackguard lieutenant to kill the people interfering with her plans. 

Loot: Blackguards usually have treasures equivalent to three or four expensive items, a few useful manifest cyphers, and an artifact weapon or armor.

CAMBION 5 (15)

Fine ebony scales cover a cambion’s perfectly athletic figure. Two reddish horns grow from

its brow, and the tips of fangs emerge from between its dusky lips. Its eyes, absent iris and

pupil, are the color of driven snow. Cambions are cursed creatures, born of mortal and

demonic parentage, and are also sometimes called helborn. Most cambions give in to what

everyone expects of them, and embrace evil.

Motive: Defense, conquest, revenge on a world that’s rejected them

Environment: Anywhere, often hiding in plain sight

Health: 25

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Disguise as level 7

Combat: Cambions sometimes wield heavy weapons in combat, especially if they come across an artifact that can enhance their attacks. Some cambions develop their natural and magical abilities to become powerful sorcerers, but most can call up hellish energy merely by willing it at least once per day, as follows.

Finger of Torture: A ruby ray lances out from the cambion’s finger to strike an enemy prone with torturous pain on a failed Might defense task. The target automatically takes 6 points of damage each round until they can escape the effect with an Intellect task.

Soulfire Blast: An explosion of soul-rending black and crimson fire explodes around up to three targets standing next to each other within short range, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the targets so that they lose their next action on a failed Speed defense task.

Interaction: Cambions are bleak, depressed, and misunderstood. Most have turned to evil, but a few can be redeemed.

Use: A great fire is seen burning on the horizon. The next day, travelers come across a burned region with a crater that has destroyed a farmhouse. At the center of the crater is an unconscious human with hornlike growths on its head.

Loot: Powerful cambions sometimes wield artifacts as weapons.

CORRUPT MAGE 7 (21)

Some wizards and sorcerers are tempted by dark magic, inevitably damning their souls and corrupting their flesh as they cut corners and delve into forbidden lore. Their research and experimentation create new kinds of rampaging monsters and turn people into misshapen horrors. They sometimes modify their own bodies in order to gain demonic or draconic powers, or make pacts with such creatures for knowledge and magical ingredients. 

Motive: Magical knowledge at all costs 

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually with fleshbeast minions 

Health: 35 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge of arcane lore, demons, and altering bodies as level 8 

Combat: Corrupt mages blast opponents with beams of energy that blister, slash, and rot flesh, attacking up to three creatures as an action. Many of them have given themselves long claws and teeth that they can use to make up to three melee attacks per action. 

A corrupt mage knows many spells, such as the following:

>  • Armor: Covers a creature with ugly scales, granting them +3 to Armor for an hour. 
>
> • Madness: Wracks the brain of one creature within short range for one hour, reducing them to a babbling catatonic state in which they can’t recognize friend or foe. If disturbed or harmed, the creature is likely to lash out with lethal force at what it perceives as its tormentors. 
>
> • Organ Request: Extracts a handful of internal organs from an opponent within short range, moving the creature one step down the damage track if it fails a Might defense roll. 
>
> • Polymorph: Transforms one foe within short range into a tiny, helpless creature such as a cockroach, fish, or snail for one hour. 
>
> • Summon Demon: Summons a demon to serve the mage for one hour. 
>
> • Teleport: Moves the mage up to 100 miles (160 km) away, or less far if they bring additional creatures with them. 
>
> • Twist Flesh: Reshapes the flesh of a creature within close range, turning it into a hideous monstrosity for one hour. The transformed creature’s actions are hindered, but its physical attacks inflict +3 points of damage. The mage’s control over the creature is limited to indicating which target it should attack. 
>
> A corrupt mage usually has several cyphers useful in combat and perhaps an artifact as well. 

Interaction: Corrupt mages generally can’t be trusted and see other creatures as things to experiment on and vivisect. They might negotiate with someone who brings them a rare specimen or spell. Many are mentally disturbed by their research and self-alterations and may fluctuate between calm clarity, obsession, paranoia, and rage. 

Use: The strange hybrid monsters emerging from the forest are said to be the creations of a corrupt mage. A corrupt mage in a calm state presents themselves as a neutral or benevolent wizard seeking assistance on a task. 

> Loot: A corrupt mage has 1d6 cyphers and perhaps a wizardly artifact.

CYCLOPS 7 (21)

Cyclopes resemble massive humans that stand 50 to 60 feet (15 to 18 m) tall and weigh about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg). Everything about these giants is exaggerated, from the thick features of their faces to their oversized hands and lumpy, corpulent bodies. They clothe themselves in animal skins, scraps of cloth, or canvas stolen during their travels. A cyclops’s most distinctive feature is the single eye positioned in the center of its forehead. Cyclopes live on the edges of civilized areas or on remote islands. For all their power and stature, they aren’t especially brave, and most have a dim idea that puny humans have an advantage when they have numbers on their side.

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 32

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Attacks targets within immediate range as level 5 due to poor eyesight; Speed defense as level 5 due to size; Intellect defense as level 4 

Combat: A cyclops can always resort to using its fists in melee, pummeling opponents with knuckles the size of large hogs. However, most cyclopes carry a tree trunk and use it to sweep enemies from their path. Due to its massive height, a cyclops can make a melee attack against creatures within short range. 

> Cyclopes can pry up boulders from the ground and throw them at targets within long range. A thrown boulder inflicts 8 points of damage to all targets in an immediate area. 
>
> Killing a cyclops can be dangerous. When killed, it falls away from the attacker that delivered the killing blow. Any creature under it when it falls must make a successful Speed defense roll or be pinned under its corpse and take 7 points of damage. Escaping from under a dead cyclops requires a successful Might roll. 

Interaction: Cyclopes know the language of the lands they inhabit, but they are notoriously dim and easily fooled. A cyclops thinks about its belly first and foremost and doesn’t pay much attention to what it stuffs in its mouth. 

Use: A cyclops has been rampaging across the countryside, and warriors sent to deal with it have been vanquished. PCs who investigate learn that the cyclops has been robbed and is trying to find the stolen item. 

Loot: Most cyclopes carry sacks filled with things they find interesting or plan to eat. Aside from the rubbish, a typical sack contains 1d100 coins of the realm and a couple of cyphers.

DEMON LORD 9 (27)

Demon lords are mighty demons, commanding hundreds of lesser fiends and often ruling an entire hellscape dimension. No mere brutes, they are smart, wield powerful magic, make centuries-long plans of conquest against rival demons, and seek to corrupt and enslave powerful mortals. Some are nearly as powerful as gods and are worshipped as such by cultists or evil creatures, claiming ownership of a concept like murder, rot, undeath, or seduction. A few are known to mate with mortals to produce cambion offspring. 

Motive: Power, conquest, souls 

Environment: Any hell dimension, sometimes called by mortal magic 

Health: 100

Damage Inflicted: 12 points 

Armor: 5 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: History and magical knowledge as level 10

Combat: A demon lord attacks with a bolt of evil energy or fire up to a long distance away, inflicting 12 points of damage on one target or 9 points of damage on all targets within short range of the primary target. Targets caught in the area attack who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 5 points of damage. A demon lord can make melee attacks on all targets within immediate range as an action. 

They can also call on a variety of other magical abilities that mimic the effect of any cypher of level 5 or lower—usually destructive, painful, and transformative effects.

 A demon lord automatically regains 3 points of health per round. They typically have the following abilities: 

• Change Shape: The demon lord can take the form of a human or similar humanoid as its action, or return to its regular shape. When so changed, its disguise is nearly impenetrable without special knowledge. As a human, the demon lord is a level 7 creature. 

• Possession: The demon lord can possess a creature and still use its own abilities. 

• Summon Demon: Summon a demon or devil to serve it for one day. 

• Wish: The demon lord can grant a mortal a wish (up to level 9) in exchange for an appropriate payment or service, but the wish is often twisted or has hidden consequences. 

Interaction: Demon lords are willing to bargain with mortals if it leads to the mortal’s corruption or advances the demon’s agenda in some way. They sometimes respond to flattery or bribes of powerful souls or magic items. 

Use: A mad cult wants to summon a demon lord in order to end the world. A mysterious stranger offers aid in exchange for a favor to be named later. 

Loot: A demon lord often has an artifact relating to some aspect of its nature or interests, such as a weapon, ring, or armor, as well as 1d6 cyphers.

ELEMENTAL, AIR 4 (12)

Air elementals are capricious pieces of air with simple minds. They spontaneously appear in clouds and high mountains, and often resemble an area of mist or a cloudlike humanoid shape. 

Motive: Mischief and destruction 

Environment: Anywhere the wind blows 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Long when flying 

Modifications: Stealth as level 6  
Combat: Air elementals slice foes up to a short distance away with blades of fierce wind, or use blasts of air to throw small objects. Once every other round, an air elemental can turn into a tornado-like vortex that inflicts 4 points of damage to all creatures within immediate range. In this form, the elemental gains +1 to Armor and an additional +2 to Armor against physical projectile weapons such as arrows and javelins. The elemental reverts to its normal form at the start of its next turn. 

An air elemental can disperse itself over a short area as an action. In this form it is invisible, unable to attack, and can’t be attacked except with area attacks. The elemental can remain in this form indefinitely, but must use an action to return to its normal form. 

Air elementals are elusive opponents and hard to destroy. If an air elemental is reduced to 0 health, there is a 50 percent chance that it rejuvenates a few rounds later with 6 health. The elemental then continues to fight or flees to cause trouble elsewhere. 

Interaction: Air elementals see and hear many things, but they are flighty and what they remember usually isn’t important or relevant. They can be summoned with magic but don’t like being controlled, and there is a 10 percent chance that they free themselves and strike out on their own. 

Use: A safe mountain trail has become hazardous due to unseasonal winds that threaten to push travelers off a cliff. An old tree is surrounded by whispers of conversations that took place recently and has started hurling sticks and fruit at anyone who comes too close.

ELEMENTAL, THORN 6 (18)

The grisly sign of an active thorn elemental in areas of heavy woods or jungle is the presence of shriveled bodies dangling from vines, dead of strangulation and poison. Thorn elementals take form in areas dense with woody growth under threat by hatchet, axe, saw, and, sometimes, human-caused climate disruptions. 

Motive: Defense of forests 

Environment: Anywhere trees grow 

Health: 36 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Immediate 

Combat: Thorn elementals batter foes with thorny, vine-wrapped fists. Targets who suffer damage must make a successful Might defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage from a paralytic poison transmitted by a thorn’s prick. Worse, the poison continues to inflict 2 points of Speed damage each round until the victim succeeds at a Might defense roll. 

As its action, a thorn elemental can disentangle its form and reassemble a new body anywhere within long range where trees and plants grow. A thorn elemental regains 2 points of health each time it travels in this fashion. 

Interaction: Thorn elementals communicate through speech, though they generally disdain talking to creatures of the animal kingdom. Thorn elementals exist within a hierarchy; those that have a greater capacity for communication are also usually more powerful. Summoned thorn elementals have about a 5 percent chance of breaking the geas and turning on their summoner. 

Use: Adventuring characters journey through a forest that is under threat of destruction by an encroachment of other humanoids. Thinking the PCs are part of the encroachers, a thorn elemental attacks them. If communication is opened, it might break off hostilities and instead ask the characters to help. 

Loot: The bodies of those previously defeated by thorn elementals dangle from the forest or jungle canopy with all their former possessions. One or two might have a cypher and other tools and treasure.

ELEMENTAL, WATER 4 (12)

Water elementals are animate masses of water. When swimming, they are nearly indistinguishable from their surroundings, but when they have to move on dry land, they usually take the form of a curling wave, amorphous blob, or large puddle. They can spontaneously appear in locations with pristine salt or fresh water. 

Motive: Flood, drown, and wash away 

Environment: Anywhere there is flowing water 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Short; long if swimming 

Modifications: Swimming and aquatic maneuvers as level 6; stealth as level 6 when in water 

Combat: Water elementals bash opponents with heavy limbs of water or spray jets of water out to short range. 

Instead of a bashing attack, a water elemental can use its action to attempt to envelop, smother, and crush one opponent, who can resist with a Might defense roll. If the opponent fails, it takes 4 points of damage immediately and every round on the elemental’s turn. Each following turn, the enveloped character must attempt a new Might defense roll every round or move one step down the damage track from drowning as the elemental forces itself into the creature’s lungs. The creature can free itself with a Might defense roll. An elemental with an enveloped opponent can move up to a short distance as its action; a common tactic is to dive deep, release their opponent to drown normally, then return to its previous position to fight other opponents. 

Any attack that inflicts 6 or more points of cold damage hinders a water elemental’s actions on its next turn.

Interaction: Water elementals are somewhat intelligent but think very differently from humans, so they often seem distracted and dull. They are generally compliant when summoned with magic, but there is about a 5 percent chance that they break free of the spell and lash out against their summoner. 

Use: Offerings left at a sacred pond have gone missing, and the water itself seems threatening. Garbage or dead bodies have polluted a water source, spawning an angry elemental that attacks everyone until the mess is cleaned up.

EVIL PRIEST 7 (21)

Evil priests are worshippers of evil gods, demons, devils, strange malevolent forces from beyond known dimensions, or even death itself. They lead cults, corrupt the innocent with lies and twisted ideologies, and enact the will of their patron in the mortal world. The most insidious ones are able to infiltrate good churches and secular organizations in order to tear them down from the inside. 

Motive: Domination of others, divine rule 

Environment: Almost anywhere that people live 

Health: 28 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Deception, persuasion, and religious lore as level 8 

Combat: Evil priests make one or two short-range magical attacks as an action, which are thematically appropriate to the god or entity they serve, such as blasts of hellfire, grasping shadowy tentacles, or disruptive necromantic energy. They often rely on zealous minions to protect them from melee opponents. 

Priests usually know several spells, such as how to banish or control creatures from other dimensions, create an area of darkness, see and hear remote locations, speak with the dead, mesmerize or paralyze a person, cause blindness, or create a ward against energy damage. They also have the following magical abilities: 

• Curse: The priest curses a foe within short range, hindering all of the foe’s actions by two steps. 

• Heal: The priest heals a touched creature for 10 health or removes an affliction such as a disease or curse. 

• Necromancy: The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to animate up to four human-sized corpses as skeletons or zombies under their control. The undead revert to corpses after a day. 

• Sacrifice: The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to kill a helpless, restrained, or unconscious creature of level 4 or higher, using its soul to grant one ally an asset on all actions and defenses for one day. 

• Summon: Once per hour the priest can summon a demon or one level 3 or 4 creature (such as a giant snake, giant spider, or swarm of bugs). The summoned creature serves the priest for an hour before vanishing. 

• An evil priest usually has one or two combat-useful manifest cyphers and often has an artifact appropriate to their religion. Most also wear armor or have an ongoing defensive spell that grants them Armor. 

Interaction: Evil priests tend to be knowledgeable, arrogant, and condescending toward heroes and members of rival faiths. They might strike a bargain to save their lives or the life of a valuable minion, or to gain an advantage later on. 

Use: An evil priest is converting frightened peasants into followers, and turning those who refuse into zombie slaves. A new religious figure in the city is acting suspiciously, and members of rival faiths have been disappearing or turning up dead. 

Loot: Evil priests usually have mundane treasures equivalent to three or four expensive items, a few useful manifest cyphers, and an artifact.

FAERIE 3 (9)

Faeries are magic creatures of music, mirth, tricks, and taunts. Some might only perform a silly song or follow people for a while, flitting around and asking questions like an annoying young child. Some faeries are crueler and delight in stealing clothing, equipment, or prized objects. And a few are downright malicious and, under the guise of a helpful guide or a pretty light in the distance, lure lost travelers to various dooms. 

Motive: Unpredictable 

Environment: Alone or in a flutter of three to twelve 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Immediate; long when flying 

Modifications: Tasks related to performance and deception as level 5; Speed defense as level 5 due to size and quickness 

Combat: A faerie can hurl damaging magic dust at any target within short range, but sometimes it wields tiny weapons such as bows, spears, or swords. 

If a faerie is touched or struck by a melee weapon, more magic dust puffs away from the faerie and clouds the attacker, who must make a Speed defense roll or take the same amount of damage they just dealt to the faerie. 

A faerie can see in the dark, but it can also emit bright light and appear as a glowing humanoid or an illuminated sphere. 

Faeries regenerate 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0. 

Some faeries can attempt to use a song or light display to charm others within short range. The target must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or fall into a suggestible state for one hour. During this period, the target can be led by the faerie at their regular movement rate. The target can be brought out of the spell early if they take damage or are heartily slapped and shaken for a round or two, causing the glamour to fade. A faerie can use this power once per minute. 

Interaction: Faeries are mercurial creatures, but except for the malicious ones, they can be negotiated with, especially if offered sweets, wine, or other gifts. However, faerie attention spans are limited, so even one that means well could end up leaving the PCs in the lurch at just the wrong moment. 

Use: The dancing light in the distance, leading curious PCs deeper and deeper into the dark woods, is a faerie. And the destination could be a wicked witch or other unpleasant location.

Loot: The tiny pouches that faeries carry are stuffed with forest bric-a-brac, but some of those pouches are ten times larger on the inside and might hold a handful of shiny coins or a cypher.

GORGON 5 (15)

Statues littering the grounds outside a ruin are meant to deter savvy robbers and explorers. The statues, ranging in size from birds to warriors astride steeds, all depict creatures in states of fright and pain, the final image of death. These pieces are not the work of a fevered mind, but the fates of those who braved a gorgon’s lair. Gorgons were humans once. After they offended the gods with their vanity, they were transformed into hideous monsters. A gorgon has the upper body of a human of perfect form and physique, but the lower body of a giant serpent, complete with rattling tail. One who dares look at a gorgon’s face can see traces of the old beauty beneath a weary veneer, darkened by hatred. Instead of hair, serpents crown a gorgon’s head, snapping and hissing at anyone who draws near. Yet the most terrible aspect of a gorgon is its gaze, which can turn any creature to stone. 

Motive: Isolation, defense 

Environment: Alone, sequestered in the isolated ruins of old cities and castles 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: Short 

Combat: A gorgon has a long-range bow attack. Since creatures that see the gorgon often turn to stone, it must take down its prey at long range so it can get fresh meat. In close combat, a gorgon lashes out with a long dagger or, rarely, a sword. As part of the action the gorgon uses to attack, the serpents on its head can also attack one target within immediate distance. A target that fails its Speed defense roll takes 2 points of damage from the bite and must immediately make a Might defense roll to resist the poison (which deals 4 additional points of Speed damage that ignores Armor). 

Anyone within short range of a gorgon who meets its gaze and fails a Might defense roll turns to stone. In combat, when a character within short distance attacks the gorgon, they must avert their gaze (which hinders the attack by two steps) or make a Might defense roll. On a failure, they take 5 points of ambient damage as their flesh partly mineralizes. If the character is killed by this damage, they are turned to stone.

 Some gorgons carry a couple of cyphers and perhaps an artifact that they can use in combat. 

Interaction: Bitterness consumes gorgons. They lead lonely lives, cut off from everyone they have loved. Negotiating with one would be something of a feat. 

Use: A gorgon’s head retains its power to petrify for several days after being cut from the creature. The PCs might brave the gorgon so they can use its head to defeat an even more powerful foe. 

Loot: A gorgon typically has a few cyphers and may have an artifact as well.

HAG 6 (18)

Hags are evil magical creatures distantly related to the fey. They resemble withered ancient humans with obvious inhuman features—dead eyes, green or purple skin, metal teeth, webbed fingers, and seaweed-like hair are common traits. They love corrupting pure and innocent things, and feast on the dreams and flesh of their victims. 

Motive: Power, treachery 

Environment: Forests, swamps, mountains, and unpleasant natural locations 

Health: 25 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Lying, haggling, magical lore, mimicking voices, and Intellect defense as level 7 

Combat: Hags can attack with their iron-hard claws and teeth, but often rely on their magic abilities in combat. Hags can breathe water, and usually have three or more of the following abilities: 

• Arcane blast: Use magical energy to blast one foe within short range and inflict 6 points of damage, or divide this energy (and damage) among several foes as the hag sees fit (each foe makes their own Speed defense roll against this attack). 

• Change shape: Transform into a humanoid or common animal, or return to their own form. 

• Curse: Curse a creature within long range, hindering all physical actions by two steps. 

• Fear: Terrify all creatures within short range who look upon them, causing the creatures to flee for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll. 

• Illusion: Create an illusion affecting a small area that includes light, sound, and smell. They can use this to disguise themselves as any humanoid creature (such as a human, dwarf, or elf). Changing or maintaining the illusion is not an action. 

• Invisibility: Turn invisible for ten minutes. When invisible, they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. 

• Murderous glare: Glare at one opponent, causing bloody wounds that inflict 6 points of damage if the creature is within short range (3 points if within long range). 

• Question: Get an answer to a very simple, general question about a creature or place within 1 mile (1.5 km). 

• Scrying eye: View any familiar location within 1 mile as if they were observing it directly. 

• Sleep: Make a creature fall asleep for one minute. Damage or loud noises will wake the creature. 

Three or more allied hags form a coven, which allows them to use each other’s magical abilities, and usually grants the coven (when working together) one or two additional abilities. 

Interaction: Hags are evil, greedy, hateful, and cruel. They rarely do things for others unless they benefit in some way, and they like to trick fools into dangerous tasks that end up profiting the hag instead of anyone else. If shown proper respect and bribed or paid, a hag can be a valuable source of lore. 

Use: The smell of cakes lures children to a mysterious woodland shack. The hag of the swamp is said to kill anyone who enters their territory without carrying a specific gift. 

Loot: In addition to coins and jewels, a hag usually has several scrolls or potions and may have an artifact.

HARPY 3 (9)

A harpy is a hideous, filthy creature with the body of a large vulture and the neck and head of an ugly human. Their breath reeks of decay, their wings and talons drip with an unpleasant oil, and their eyes shed acrid tears. They love to torment people and lure them to their deaths. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh, causing anguish 

Environment: Coastline, forest, and mountains 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: Perception and Speed defense as level 4 

Combat: Harpies are fast and strong, capable of carrying off a light adult human. They attack with their long talons. 

Anything a harpy touches becomes fouled with their smelly fluids, and one harpy energetically flapping their wings is enough to contaminate an immediate area. Their fluids are repulsive but not directly harmful, and the smell persists even after a casual washing. Any food touched by harpy filth is inedible to anyone but a harpy. Creatures with a sensitive sense of smell (such as dogs and wolves) are hindered when within a short distance of a harpy. It is common for a group of harpies to attack a campsite or festival, spread their stink over everything, and fly away with whatever food they can carry.

A harpy can sing a weird, entrancing song that hypnotizes whoever hears it. Anyone within long range who hears the song must make an Intellect defense roll or stop whatever they are doing and attempt to approach the harpy. If the creature comes within an immediate distance of a singing harpy, they stand there dumbly even as the harpy attacks them. The creature can make another attempt to break free each round on its turn, and taking damage from anything other than a singing harpy allows them another attempt to break free. Five or more harpies can work together on the same song (treat as a level 5 effect). Harpies are cruel and have been known to lead an entranced creature into a pit, off a cliff, or over the railing of a ship. 

Interaction: Other than their singing, harpies do not usually speak with other creatures. They are more likely to jeer and screech at people like an angry bird than try to communicate. 

Use: A flock of harpies torments a village during its harvest festival, ruining the celebration and some of the food set aside for the winter. Sailors speak of a lonely island where an old, blind king starves because harpies steal or foul any food set out for him. 

Loot: A harpy nest may have one or two cyphers or other valuables, but the items will smell disgusting unless carefully washed.

HOLLOW KNIGHT 4 (12)

In haunted castles and among the armies mustered by those with power over life and death, sometimes walk hollow knights. These animated suits of armor move just like living people, and many who encounter these dread revenants mistake them for living foes only to realize in horror that there’s nothing inside except for the memory of the warrior that once donned the suit. Brought into being by binding the spirit of a dead warrior to its panoply, hollow knights behave in much the same way they did in life—disciplined, loyal, and battle ready. Clad head to toe in full plate armor, with battered shields strapped to their arms and rusty swords gripped in lobster gauntlets, the knights stand ready to face any foe, heedless of the danger, driven to serve the necromancer that made them. Hollow knights might ride on the backs of skeletal steeds and wield lances. 

Motive: Obedience to its master 

Environment: Anywhere 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short; long while mounted on a skeletal steed 

Modifications: Resists fear and intimidation as level 10 

Combat: A hollow knight usually fights with a sword or mace. 

When mounted on a steed, a hollow knight charges its enemies whenever possible. As an action, its steed moves a short distance, and the hollow knight can make a single attack at any point during this movement. When attacking in this way, the knight inflicts 7 points of damage. 

A hollow knight is fearless and fights until destroyed or ordered to pull back. The magic animating its armor is slow to fade, so armor components may continue to twitch and jerk even after the knight has fallen. Usually, when defeated, the suit of armor falls apart, and wisps of grey smoke curl up from the remains. 

Interaction: Hollow knights cannot speak. They obey any orders given to them by their creators. 

Use: The necromancer or other magician that binds the spirit to the armor also imbues the armor with specific commands—tasks the knight must carry out until destroyed. Some knights may stand guard at citadels or mansions, keeping a vigil until their armor finally falls apart. Others are more active and may function as the core of a dark wizard’s army.

HYDRA 7 (21)

This mythological reptile has five writhing serpent heads, each of which constantly exhales a venomous plume. Well over 20 feet (6 m) long from the tip of its longest head to its thrashing tail, the toxic beast’s most discomfiting feature is its magical ability to sprout new heads when it’s wounded. Some hydras dwell on land, others in water. Most seem to have been set as guardians of important places by higher powers, which is probably why they’re so difficult to kill. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh, defend a location 

Environment: Swamps, coasts, and forests 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short when walking or swimming 

Modifications: Perception as level 8 due to its many heads; Speed defense as level 5 due to size 

Combat: Even approaching a hydra is dangerous; the air around it is poisoned by its venomous breath. Each round a creature is within immediate range of a hydra, they must succeed on a Might defense task or take 1 point of Speed damage (ignores Armor). 

All five of a hydra’s heads can simultaneously bite foes in immediate range. If three or more heads coordinate their attack, the heads make one attack as a single level 9 creature dealing 9 points of damage. A target bitten by the venomous hydra must also succeed on a Might defense task or take an additional 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). 

Whenever the hydra takes 4 or more points of damage from a single attack, a healing pulse surges through the creature a round later. The pulse returns the health just subtracted due to the attack and triggers the immediate growth of two additional heads that sprout from the creature. (The same thing happens if one of the creature’s snakelike heads is decapitated.) The new heads are just as effective as the original ones in a fight. Fire, electrical, and other extreme energy attacks do not trigger the healing pulse and head genesis. 

Interaction: A hydra is a cunning predator, but not intelligent. It can’t bargain or negotiate. 

Use: The PCs investigate an ancient ruin hoping to find artifacts of the gods. A hydra saw them enter and trails them through the crumbling structure at a considerable distance, waiting for them to take a rest or become otherwise distracted before attacking.

 Loot: Hydras sometimes collect cyphers and artifacts in their lair, or failing that, they guard something of value.

## JOTUNN (NORSE GIANT)

Jotunns are a type of giant—large, somewhat intelligent, bad-tempered, and cultured in their own way, but generally hostile to humans and other “little folk.” Jotunns range from 9 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) tall, are strong, have long hair, and wear armor and use weapons like humans do. Some are hideous, some are attractive by human standards, and some have multiple heads. They live in caves, lodges, or large castles. There are two main types of jotunns: fire and frost.

JOTUNN, FIRE 6 (18)

Fire jotunns are often called fire giants. Their skin is coal-grey or black; their hair is red or gold and may be metal or actual flames. They prefer hot mountainous climates (particularly volcanoes), wear plate armor, and use greatswords that glow with the natural heat of their bodies. 

Motive: Destruction, hungers for flesh, honor 

Environment: Hot mountains, volcanic areas, supernatural fires 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points plus 3 points from fire 

Armor: 3 (immune to fire) 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws objects as level 8 

Combat: A fire jotunn uses weapons appropriate to its size (which would be two-handed for a human but can be wielded one-handed by the giant), inflicting 6 points of damage plus another 3 points of ambient fire damage conducted from the jotunn’s body. Jotunns throw boulders up to very long range, inflicting 6 points of damage plus 3 points of fire damage. 

A jotunn can inflict 1 point of fire damage with a touch, and anyone touching it without protection against fire takes damage as if the jotunn had touched them. A slain fire jotunn and its equipment are too hot to safely touch for several minutes. 

Fire jotunns are immune to fire damage, but take additional damage from cold (equal to the attack’s normal damage, up to a maximum of 5 additional points of cold damage). 

Fire jotunn leaders sometimes have magical powers, usually related to earth and fire. 

Interaction: Fire jotunns tend to be hostile, but they may agree to a nonlethal challenge to allow visitors to pass through their land or join them for a feast. 

Use: A fire jotunn decides to cause trouble for intruders in its territory. A clan of jotunns wages war against a fortified village or town, hurling boulders, starting fires, and stealing livestock. 

Loot: Jotunns like fine things, and their homes usually have utensils, plates, weapons, and trophies made of precious metals and decorated with gems. They may have cyphers, and a leader may carry an artifact.

JOTUNN, FROST 6 (18)

Frost jotunns are often called frost giants or ice giants. Their skin is pale white, pink, or blue, and their hair is usually white, pale blond, or actual ice. They prefer cold mountains and tundra, wear chainmail and furs, and use metal axes that channel powerful cold from their bodies. 

Motive: Destruction, hungers for flesh, honor 

Environment: Cold mountains and plains 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points plus 3 points from cold 

Armor: 2 (immune to cold) 

Movement: Short; long when skiing 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws objects as level 8 

Combat: A frost jotunn uses weapons appropriate to its size (which would be two-handed for a human but can be wielded one-handed by the giant), inflicting 6 points of damage plus another 3 points of ambient cold damage conducted from the jotunn’s body. Jotunns throw boulders or chunks of ice up to very long range, inflicting 6 points of damage plus 3 points of cold damage. 

A jotunn can inflict 1 point of cold damage with a touch, and anyone touching it without protection against cold takes damage as if the jotunn had touched them. A slain frost jotunn and its equipment are too cold to safely touch for several minutes. 

Frost jotunns are immune to cold damage, but take additional damage from fire (equal to the attack’s normal damage, up to a maximum of 5 additional points of fire damage). 

Frost jotunn leaders sometimes have magical powers, usually related to illusions and weather. 

Interaction: Frost jotunns tend to be hostile, but if in a generous mood, they may allow visitors to dine with them or rest in their halls. Once they grant someone hospitality, they are loath to break it unless they are attacked, robbed, or tricked. 

Use: A frost jotunn throws a boulder just to be threatening. A clever jotunn offers to share a story in exchange for food and conversation. A clan of jotunns uses the cover of a storm to raid a village. 

Loot: Jotunns like fine things, and their homes usually have utensils, plates, weapons, and trophies made of precious materials and decorated with gems. They may have cyphers, and a leader may carry an artifact.

LICH 8 (24)

A lich is a powerful wizard or priest who has used their knowledge of necromancy to bind their soul in a magical object called a phylactery, making them immortal and undead unless their soul object is found and destroyed. Having corrupted its own life energy in an obscene ritual, a lich can pursue its other magical goals, usually the acquisition of more wealth, magic, and power. A newly made lich may look like a recent corpse, but maintaining its physical vessel becomes less of a priority as the centuries pass, so over time they tend to look withered or even skeletal. Liches often work with or command other undead, such as wraiths, skeletons, vampires, and zombies. 

Motive: Magic, immortality, power 

Environment: Wherever they can remain hidden and work undisturbed 

Health: 45 

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Intellect defense and magical lore as level 10 

Combat: A lich can shoot blasts of necromantic energy that inflict 8 points of damage on a target and 4 points on any creature within immediate range of the target. A lich knows many spells, such as the following:

 • Animate guards: Animate ten corpses as skeletons or zombies, which obey the lich for one hour before turning back into corpses.

 • Armor: Gain +5 Armor for one hour. 

• Death: Inflict 8 points of damage on a creature within short range; if the creature fails a Might defense roll, it also moves two steps down the damage track. 

• Fly: For one hour, move through the air as effortlessly as walking. 

• Paralyze: One target within short range is held motionless for two rounds, unable to take any physical actions. 

• Polymorph: Transform a creature within short range into a harmless creature like a fish or frog for one minute. 

• Scrying eye: View any familiar location within 1 mile (1.5 km) as if the lich was observing it directly. 

• Teleport: Move instantly up to 1 mile. A lich also likely carries several cyphers useful in combat. Liches are undead, and therefore immune to anything that affects only living creatures, such as disease and poison. Unless its well-hidden phylactery is destroyed, a lich that is killed reforms a new body near its phylactery over the next week or so, returning at full health and with all of its abilities and memories. 

Interaction: Liches hate being interrupted and have more important things to do than answer questions from mortal weaklings. A lich may be convinced to teach a character a spell, especially if given a spell, cypher, or artifact in trade. 

Use: A lich is planning a ritual to raise an army of skeletons or zombies to attack the kingdom. A lich has made a pact with a demon to unleash a plague in exchange for obscure magical knowledge. 

Loot: A lich has 1d6 cyphers and usually an artifact.

MANTICORE 6 (18)

A manticore is a fearsome predator that resembles a maned red lion with a human head and a scorpion’s tail. The head is bearded and has three rows of teeth in the upper and lower jaws, like a shark. The scorpion tail is covered in multiple barbs, and the creature can flick its tail to hurl these barbs at its prey. Manticores eat all of their prey, including the bones, clothing, and equipment, leaving nothing but a bloodstain as evidence of their hunting. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh (especially human flesh) 

Environment: Mountains and plains 

Health: 22 

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Long 

Modifications: Ranged attacks as level 5 

Combat: Manticores attack with their powerful bite, seeking to incapacitate or kill one opponent quickly so they can eat. Some are content to attack and consume a single target, but a large, hungry manticore prefers to wait until two or three creatures are nearby before attacking. A manticore has powerful legs and can leap up to a short distance in any direction, and often surprises its prey by leaping from concealment. 

Instead of biting, a manticore can use its poisonous scorpion-like tail to strike one creature in melee with a cluster of barbs, inflicting 4 points of damage (plus 4 additional points of Speed damage if the target fails a Might defense roll). With a flick of its tail, it can hurl up to four barbs up to a short distance away, striking one or more creatures in an immediate area. Each barb inflicts 1 point of damage, and the target must succeed on a Might defense roll or take 1 additional point of Speed damage. 

Interaction: Manticores can make trumpet-like noises that resemble speech, but this seems to be a trick to lure prey. Most of them are not intelligent enough to know how to speak human languages. 

Use: Weird musical noises resembling speech are heard from the nearby hills. People have been disappearing in fields and on the road, with only bloodstains on the ground suggesting that they were harmed. 

Loot: A manticore’s stomach might contain a piece of treasure or a cypher from a recent meal, and its lair may have one or two small objects it was unable to digest.

MERFOLK 3 (9)

Merfolk are intelligent creatures with humanlike bodies from the waist up and scaly fish bodies from the waist down. They are able to breathe air or water but prefer the sea for its beauty and their better mobility. Merfolk have great underwater cities ruled by a king or queen, but most land-walking species interact only with the common or soldier merfolk who visit the ocean surface and coastlines. Merfolk societies are much like those of surface humans; their inability to use fire limits them in some ways (such as blacksmithing), but they have compensated for this with water magic and other skills. 

Merfolk skin ranges from all human colors to green, blue, and grey. Some have small fins on their heads and elbows or webs between their fingers. They dress for comfort and wear jewelry made of shells, coral, pearls, polished gemstones, and metals they can salvage or trade for. Most of them are content to be hunters or cultivators of kelp and other aquatic plants, but some are curious about land-walkers (and their sunken ships) or fiercely territorial about protecting their waters against outsiders. 

Motive: Defense, entertainment 

Environment: Oceans, seas, and coasts

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Immediate; short when swimming 

Modifications: Perception as level 4 while in water 

Combat: Merfolk use spears, tridents, daggers, and other stabbing weapons that are effective underwater. They may create traps using nets to confine or direct foes into an ambush. A few lucky or clever ones have acquired or adapted light crossbows designed to fire underwater up to a short distance away. 

About once every ten minutes, a merperson can swim a short distance as their action and still make a melee attack, or swim up to a long distance as their action. 

About one in ten merfolk have the magical ability to harden water until it is as strong and durable as wood, taking about an hour to make a spear or similar tool that lasts for several days. Some noble merfolk can create short-range bolts of electricity as an action and make limited alterations to the weather (stilling, increasing, or dispersing wind and clouds in a very long area) by concentrating for several minutes. 

Interaction: Merfolk react according to their role in merfolk society—farmer, rancher, guard, explorer, noble, and so on. Some merfolk are more aggressive or hostile and dislike the presence of land-walkers in their territory. Most merfolk are amiable to conversation and trade with people who treat them with fairness and respect. 

Use: Merfolk are often seen sunning themselves on a small island off the coast. Merfolk warriors accompanied by trained large fish have been harassing boats and ships that stray too far from the shallows and shores. 

Loot: In addition to several small pieces of jewelry, a group of merfolk might have a manifest cypher. A noble or royal merperson usually has a cypher and might have an artifact.

MINOTAUR 4 (12)

Minotaurs are aggressive bull-humanoids who enjoy human flesh. Some legends say the first minotaur was the result of a curse from a god, and others suggest it was created by a demon, but the truth is lost to antiquity. Minotaurs care little about history or their origin, preferring to hunt for meat and spar with each other for dominance and trophies. Minotaurs live in small tribes of up to a dozen adults. Solitary minotaurs are exiles, last survivors of their tribe, or younger individuals claiming their own territory. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Caves, plains, and labyrinths 

Health: 19 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Hunting and tracking as level 5 

Combat: Minotaurs attack with their horns or use large weapons. A minotaur can charge up to a short distance and then make an attack, which inflicts an additional 3 points of damage. 

Minotaurs are interested in mazes and mazelike spaces and like to wander within them, memorizing the paths and finding good places to stage ambushes. They leave out piles of equipment and useless treasures from previous victims to lure people into the maze and give the minotaur time to corner their prey. S

ometimes one minotaur in a tribe develops simple magic powers and is able to create illusions of smoke or mist in an area a short distance across, turn invisible for a few moments, or enchant weapons to inflict bleeding wounds. 

Interaction: Minotaurs can speak, usually in their own language or another crude humanoid language. However, they typically choose not to speak to weaker creatures (such as humans). 

Use: A wandering gang of minotaurs has been stealing livestock from a local village and is ready to start hunting humans. A minotaur gladiator escaped from a secret underground arena and is stalking prey in the city. Something lurks in a corn maze, leaving nothing but bones and bloodstains. 

Loot: Minotaurs don’t have much use for coins but keep a few small trophies, such as ivory dice, gems, or simple jewelry. The most powerful minotaur in the tribe may have a cypher or even a mastercraft weapon.

MORLOCK 2 (6)

Morlocks are degenerate, blind cannibal humanoids that avoid light. They have prominent teeth, piglike eyes, loose skin, and stooped postures. They avoid bright daylight and prefer to hunt and forage when it is dark out (or at least under the twilight-like canopy of a heavy forest). Morlocks eat any sort of meat, even carrion and their own dead. Morlocks build piles of stones to mark their territory. On nights of the new moon, they create unnerving music by playing simple drums made out of skulls and logs. They lack the foresight to store food for lean times, so they range farther from home in winter and times of famine. They are sometimes enslaved by more powerful creatures such as ogres or a vampire. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh, defense 

Environment: Caves, forests, hills, and underground 

Health: 6 

Damage Inflicted: 2 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing 

Modifications: Stealth and tracking as level 4 

Combat: Morlocks fight with their nails and teeth, but sometimes they use simple weapons like clubs, stone knives, spears, and javelins if they have observed other humanoids doing so. Some tribes dig simple pit traps and chase prey into them. 

Morlocks dislike strong light but are not harmed by it. Their hearing and sense of smell is strong enough that they can “see” in dim or very dim light as if it were normal light. They can track scents as well as a trained dog. 

Interaction: Morlocks have a simple language of hoots, howls, and growls that communicate basic concepts like food, fire, danger, and cold. If enslaved by a more powerful creature, some of them can manage to learn a few words in that creature’s language. 

Use: Town elders warn that the drums and near-human howls on dark nights are signs of morlocks who’ll steal away foolish children. Stacked piles of stones are found in the forest, each surrounded by bare humanoid footprints. 

Loot: Morlocks don’t value what they can’t eat, but their lair may have a cypher or two from a recent victim.

NECROMANCER 5 (15)

The ability to influence, command, and call up the dead is an impressive power, given how many more people are dead than living. Since the only thing separating a living person from a dead one is a well-aimed knife or death spell, the number of dead always rises. 

Motive: Magical power, mastery over death 

Environment: In places where dead are interred, usually with some number of undead servitors 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to shroud of undead protective spirits 

Combat: Necromancers can blast a foe within long range with the cold of the grave or flesh-decaying magic. 

A necromancer can cast a death spell on a foe within short range once every minute; the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or move down one step on the damage track. This ability could be an innate power or come from an artifact. 

A necromancer who isn’t already accompanied by undead spirits or shambling, spirit-inhabited corpses under their command can call up a spirit as an action. A necromancer can command up to five spirits (or newly allied undead, as described below) at a time. 

A necromancer can attempt to take command of a spirit or undead creature within short range. They automatically succeed against an unaligned undead target of level 4 or less. If a targeted spirit is already allied with or in service to a PC, the PC must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or lose control of the spirit to the necromancer’s will for one minute. 

Interaction: Necromancers are feared for their nonchalant attitudes toward life, especially the life of normal people (such as peasants and city folk). They will negotiate but usually don’t have the capacity to care about another person’s well-being; they’re sociopathic. 

Use: A character has died, and their allies must find a necromancer to help retrieve their spirit. Of course, the necromancer wants something in return for this aid—perhaps an artifact pilfered from whatever underworld or hell the dead character is imprisoned within. 

Loot: Necromancers have one or two expensive items, a cypher, and possibly an artifact.

NOBLE KNIGHT 7 (21)

Whether noble or ignoble, some knights achieve an amazing mastery over weapons, combat, and courtly graces, eclipsing lesser warriors and champions. The quests of some noble knights can lead them far across the land into strange new territories where they encounter and defeat various magical creatures. 

Motive: Accomplish noble (or ignoble) deeds 

Environment: Almost anywhere, often alone, sometimes with followers 

Health: 50 

Damage Inflicted: 10 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: All tasks related to heraldic lore and chivalry as level 8; Speed defense as level 8 while holding shield 

Combat: Noble knights are armed with massive weapons they can wield in one hand, which means they can also hold a shield. They are skilled with melee weapons (such as a battleaxe, broadsword, or mace) and inflict lethal damage on a hit. 

Noble knights can also rely on a magic artifact or two to aid them, and possibly a noble steed. The artifact might be the very weapon a knight wields in combat and could grant them one or more of the following additional abilities: 

> Legendary Strength. The noble knight can call upon the artifact to grant them great strength or fortitude to accomplish a particular physical task (such as breaking down a door, lifting a boulder, or knocking down pillars holding up a structure), which they attempt as if they were level 10. 
>
> Regeneration. The noble knight regenerates 2 points of health per round while the weapon is drawn. 
>
> Resistance. The noble knight is immune to effects that would influence their mind, charm them, or put them to sleep. 

Interaction: Flowery language and impeccable manners show a knight’s noble background. Those who negotiate with one in good faith are likely to come away with something of value. However, sometimes a noble knight is corrupt and betrays trusts. 

Use: A noble knight has decided that they must guard a bridge against any who would cross it. 

Loot: Noble knights carry weapons, heavy armor, and perhaps a cypher or even an artifact.

SAPIENT TREE 3 (9)

Guardians of the wood, sapient trees stand eternally vigilant, often on the outskirts of their grove or forest to keep out those who might seek to do them—or other, ordinary trees— harm. They look like normal trees until they reveal their true nature, with limb-like branches and faces in the bark of their trunk. They don’t always move, but with effort, they can uproot themselves and walk about. However, they usually do so only when no one is looking. The origin and temperament of sapient trees varies; they might be haunted trees possessed by spirits, trees animated by magic spells, or ancient mythical beings. Some are peaceful and noble, but others are downright wicked and cruel. 

Motive: Defense 

Environment: Found in groves or copses of five to twenty 

Health: 16 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Initiative as level 4; Speed defense as level 2 due to size 

Combat: When a sapient tree attacks, it often does so with surprise because it looks like a normal tree at first. If a character about to be attacked fails an Intellect defense roll, they do not perceive the attack in time, and the tree’s attack is eased. 

> If a tree strikes in combat with one of its branch-arms, it can choose to grab the foe (rather than inflict damage) and toss them an immediate distance away, inflicting 2 points of ambient damage if they hit the ground or another solid object. If they are tossed at another creature, that second creature must make a successful Speed defense roll or also take this damage. 
>
> Sometimes, a sapient tree that bears fruit will hurl its fruit up to short range, inflicting 4 points of damage. 
>
> Interaction: Sapient trees are generally unfriendly and indignant toward animal life. They are fearful and assume that any creature not native to their forest is a threat. They are likely to attack first rather than speak, although they can speak eloquently, if sometimes slowly. 
>
> Use: These trees populate magic forests. They can be used to surprise characters with an attack from an unexpected direction.

SATYR 5 (15)

These muscular humanoids sport long curved horns and furry, hooved legs. They are self-centered, greedy, and sybaritic creatures, dedicated to food, drink, and other pleasures. They rob and steal from others as it pleases them, often relying on tricks and lies, or alluring music they play on pipes. 

Motive: Play tricks, gather treasure, fulfill desires 

Environment: Woodlands, hills, and plains 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short Modifications: Tasks related to persuasion and deception as level 7; resists mental attacks as level 7 

Combat: Satyrs usually carry spears that they can use in melee and against foes within short range. They can also create magical effects by playing their pipes as an action, which can either bolster allies or harm enemies: 

> Dance of the Leaping Stag: Foes within short range who fail an Intellect defense task lose their next turn to dancing and leaping. Attacks made against affected targets are eased. 
>
> Feral Overture: An ally within short range is infused with magic, and one attack it makes on its next turn is eased; if it hits, it inflicts +3 damage.  
> Tune of the Clouded Mind: A foe within short range who fails an Intellect defense task spends its next turn attacking one of its allies. 

Interaction: Satyrs are inveterate mercenaries. They gladly work for strong drink and other treasures, and they ally with almost any creature capable of meeting their price. A satyr is always willing to start negotiations, but is prone to lying and exaggeration. Offering excessive libation, food, and other rewards is the only way to ensure that a satyr remains honest, and then for only a short period. 

Use: Strange piping music in the forest lures away young people from a nearby community. Community elders say a charismatic cult leader has set up in the woods and clouds the minds of all who come near. 

Loot: A satyr is likely to carry one or two cyphers.

SHADOW 1 (3)

Shadows are semi-intelligent patches of darkness roughly in the shape of a humanoid creature’s silhouette. They creep along walls, floors, and ceilings, blending in with actual shadows, peeling themselves free only when they’re ready to clutch at a victim with their cold claws. 

Motive: Hunger for life energy 

Environment: Anywhere that shadows can occur 

Health: 3 

Damage Inflicted: 2 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Stealth as level 3 

Combat: Shadows attack with their claws, which feel like a cold breeze and drain 2 points of Might from their target with each hit. They can barely interact with physical objects, and even something as simple as moving a pebble an immediate distance or knocking over a candle takes intense concentration. 

A group of five shadows can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to make one attack as a single level 3 creature, inflicting 4 points of damage. In an area of complete darkness with no illumination at all, shadows are effectively powerless—they cannot attack and all their actions are hindered. If suddenly deprived of light, they slink about menacingly for a few minutes but lose interest if it seems like their prey won’t be bringing back the light. 

Shadows are flat rather than insubstantial, but attacks that harm phased, ghostly, or similar creatures are fully effective against them. They can easily pass through narrow spaces such as the gap under a door or between the bars of a cell, but cannot move through solid objects. 

Interaction: Shadows never speak, but they can make rustling noises like a gently moving curtain. If controlled or prevented from attacking, they can communicate with simple pantomimes and seem to understand some pieces of language. 

Use: The flickering shadows from a campfire bend strangely and begin to creep toward a nearby character. A person appears to have two shadows just before they feel icy coldness slide along their flesh.

SOUL EATER 5 (15)

A soul eater is the animate head of a powerful wizard who shuffled off this mortal coil to become an undead creature without ethics, feelings, or a sense of morality. Also called dread skulls, these creatures maintain their existence by occasionally absorbing the spirit or mind of living victims. An absorbed “soul” is burned away, which is why dread skulls are wreathed in flame; it’s the by-product of the creature’s previous meal. 

Motive: Hungers for souls 

Environment: Usually at the center of tombs 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Long when flying 

Modifications: Resists mental attacks and deception as level 7; Speed defense as level 7 due to size and quickness; knowledge of arcane methodologies and rituals as level 8 

Combat: A soul eater has a library of magic abilities it can draw upon, including long-range attacks of fire or cold against all targets within immediate range of each other, the ability to read the mind of a victim within short range on a failed Intellect defense roll, and the ability to cloak itself in the illusion of a normal human for up to an hour at a time. 

In addition, a dread skull can draw out a victim’s consciousness and absorb it in a blaze of supernatural fire. To do so, the creature must bite a target, which inflicts 5 points of damage; the target must then succeed on an Intellect defense roll or take an additional 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). 

If a dread skull drains a character’s Intellect Pool to 0 through repeated bites, the character’s soul is sucked into the skull, and the body falls limp. Once absorbed into the skull, a victim’s essence is trapped and slowly consumed over the next twenty-four hours. During this period, the skull regenerates 1 point of health per round. 

If a dread skull isn’t destroyed within twenty-four hours of eating a soul, the victim’s essence is fully consumed. If the soul eater is defeated and its skull is shattered before then, all unconsumed souls are returned to their bodies. 

Interaction: Dread skulls are slightly insane but hellishly smart, which means that sometimes they will negotiate to get what they want. 

Use: Soul eaters remember a little bit of the knowledge of every creature’s essence they consume. The PCs need to learn the command word of an artifact they’ve found, but the only one who knew it was consumed by a dread skull. 

Loot: Sometimes dread skulls keep treasures as trophies of past victories, consisting of 1d6 cyphers and maybe an artifact.

SPHINX 7 (21)

A sphinx is a magical creature with a large lionlike body, feathered wings, and a head that is like that of a human or some kind of animal (typically a hawk or ram). Wise and fierce, sphinxes have a connection to the divine and are often found guarding temples or persons of great interest to the gods (although whether they serve good or evil depends on the individual sphinx). No matter what their head looks like, a sphinx can devour creatures as easily and quickly as a lion. 

Motive: Defense, riddles 

Environment: Deserts, plains, and mountains 

Health: 25 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: Intellect defense and magical lore as level 8 

Combat: A sphinx attacks with its lion claws, making two swipes as its action. A sphinx also has the following magical abilities: 

• Curse: Curse a creature within long range, hindering all their physical actions by two steps until some other magic lifts the curse. 

• Heal: Restore 10 health to an NPC, or allow a PC to use their next action to make a recovery roll that does not count toward their normal allotment. Can be used three times per day. 

• Riddle: A creature within long range must make an Intellect defense roll to answer a difficult riddle; failure means the creature stands confused for one minute even if they are attacked. 

• Spellbreaker: End an ongoing magical effect within short range, such as a curse or protective spell. If there are multiple effects, the sphinx chooses which one to end. It can target an immediate area instead of a specific effect (such as an area where it suspects an invisible enemy is hiding). 

• Teleport: Instantaneously move a very long distance. Can be used once per day. 

Interaction: Sphinxes are very intelligent and speak several languages (including at least one ancient or obscure language). If their demands are met (such as by answering a riddle or performing a service), they can be quite talkative, if arrogant. 

Use: A sphinx guards the main road into the city, killing anyone who fails to answer its riddle. A sphinx approaches, offering secret lore if the characters can direct it to a suitable mate or an abandoned temple it can restore and guard. 

Loot: A sphinx usually has one or two cyphers and perhaps a small artifact it can wear and use.

TROLL 6 (18)

A troll is a hideous humanoid standing at least 10 feet (3 m) tall that hunts more by smell than by sight. They are dangerous but not particularly intelligent. Always ravenous, trolls eat anything, and rarely take the time to cook a meal. Usually, they distend their mouths and throats and swallow subdued prey whole. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Nearly anywhere, hunting alone or in pairs 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Long 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size; Might defense as level 7; sees through deception as level 4 

Combat: The troll attacks with its claws. If it hits, it grabs a foe tightly, then squeezes and bites until the victim is dead or it releases that victim to attack another creature. Each round that a held creature does not escape, they take 10 points of damage. 

Trolls regain 3 points of health per round. If a troll suffers a particularly egregious wound (10 or more points of damage in one round), rather than regain health in that round (and instead of taking any other action), the troll divides into two level 4 trolls that are 3 feet (1 m) tall. Spawned trolls that survive the battle and have access to food grow into full-power trolls within a few weeks. 

Interaction: Trolls speak their own simple language, but a few know a little bit of a local human language. Most prefer to attack and eat other creatures, but might be bargained with after a successful show of force. 

Use: Trolls may be chance encounters in the wilderness for unlucky travelers. Sometimes captured trolls are used by slavers, armies, and powerful wizards as guards and warriors.

WORM THAT WALKS 7 (21)

This sodden, leather-wrapped humanoid smells of the sea. It moves effortlessly through the air, levitating above the ground while its damp wrappings writhe and squirm as if infested with thousands of worms—because they are. Each worm that walks is a mass of psionic grubs squirming through a slush of salty ooze. Individually the grubs are harmless vermin, but together they’re a sentient entity, a single psionic mind formed of thousands of tiny, maggot-like pupae. The tightly wound leather straps covering a worm that walks are just as important for hiding its true nature as for adhesion. Despite being fully encased, the worm that walks senses its environment with a hard-to-fool sixth sense. 

Motive: Domination of other creatures, hunger 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 30 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 1 

Movement: Immediate; short when flying 

Modifications: Perception as level 8; Speed defense as level 5 due to slow nature 

Combat: A worm that walks can strike a single target in immediate range with a leather-wrapped “fist” as its action. When it hits and deals damage, several grubs spill out and attach to the victim (getting under most armor unless it’s hermetically sealed or behind a force field), who must make a Might defense roll to shake them loose. On a failure, the grubs begin to feed, and the target takes 5 points of damage (ignores Armor).

If a victim is killed while in immediate range of a worm that walks, the worms automatically engulf the body through a wide opening in their wrappings. The grubs go into a feeding frenzy, reducing the remains to nothing within minutes. During the frenzy, the worm that walks regenerates 2 points of health per round. A victim’s equipment is retained for later study. 

A worm that walks can also emit a psychic burst that can target up to three creatures in short range as its action. On a failed Intellect defense roll, a victim suffers 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and is unable to take actions on their subsequent turn. If the victim is attacked while so stunned, their defenses are hindered by two steps. 

Interaction: A worm that walks can communicate telepathically with characters within short range. It negotiates only with those strong enough to harm it; otherwise, it tries to eat whoever it runs across. Even if the worm that walks makes a deal, it eventually reneges if it senses any advantage for doing so. 

Use: A worm that walks has been active in a small rural community for weeks, apparently in preparation for something it calls “the Great Hatching.” If that refers to the hatching of more psychic grubs, it could spell trouble for a much larger region. 

Loot: A worm that walks might have one or two cyphers, though during combat it will use any devices that could help it in the fight.

WRAITH 2 (6)

When a spirit of a dead creature fails to find its way to the afterworld, escapes the same, or is summoned forth by a necromancer, it may become a wraith: a bodiless spirit of rage and loss. A wraith appears as a shadowy or misty figure that can resemble the humanoid figure it once was, though wraiths tend to swarm together, making it difficult to distinguish them from each other. Wraiths are often mindless, consumed by their condition. But on occasion, a wraith not too far gone still remembers its life and may respond to questions or seek to locate its loved ones or enemies. A wraith may even attempt to finish a task it started in life. But in time, even the strongest-willed spirit’s mind erodes without physical substance to renew it, and it becomes an almost mindless monster of destruction. 

Motive: Destruction 

Environment: Almost anywhere, singly or in groups of six to ten 

Health: 6 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short while flying 

Modifications: Stealth as level 5 

Combat: A wraith attacks with its touch, which rots flesh and drains life. 

A wraith can become fully insubstantial. After it does so, the creature can’t change state again until its next turn. While insubstantial, it can’t affect or be affected by anything (except for weapons and attacks that specifically affect undead or phased creatures), and it can pass through solid matter without hindrance, but even simple magical wards can keep it at bay. While partly insubstantial (its normal state), a wraith can affect and be affected by others normally. 

A group of five wraiths can act as a swarm, focusing on one target to make one attack roll as a single level 4 creature dealing 5 points of damage. 

Interaction: Most wraiths moan and scream in rage. The rare few that retain reason can speak in a sepulchral voice, and they may even negotiate. Any alliance with a wraith is usually short-lived, since the creature eventually forgets itself and descends fully into rage and the desire to spread destruction. 

Use: The PCs are attacked while attending a burial, or they happen to pass close to or camp near a graveyard. Another swarm of wraiths appears in a location where an earlier group was destroyed (indicating a necromancer is summoning them).

WYVERN 6 (18)

Wyverns are aggressive lesser cousins of dragons. Their bodies are about the size of a heavy horse but their wingspan makes them seem much larger. Lacking a dragon’s fiery breath or other magical abilities, wyverns rely on their strong flight and deadly stinger to catch and kill their prey, typically humanoids or large animals. Wyverns have four limbs— two legs used for clumsy walking and two arm-wings used for flight and balance. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Mountains, hills, and plains where large prey is plentiful 

Health: 35 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short; long when flying 

Modifications: Perception as level 7; Speed defense as level 5 due to size 

Combat: Wyverns prefer to attack from the air, moving up to a short distance and making three attacks (bite, venomous stinger, claws) as their action. If a wyvern has to fight on the ground, it can attack only with its bite and stinger on its turn. 

The stinger injects poison, dealing an additional 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if the opponent fails a Might defense roll. Because the wyvern hunts primarily out of hunger, it usually focuses its attacks on one creature, weakening the prey so the wyvern can carry it away and eat in peace. 

Interaction: Wyverns lack the intelligence of true dragons. They are relatively smart animals (on par with large reptiles such as crocodiles) but can be distracted by easy prey. Allowing one to catch a pig, pony, or riding horse can give characters enough time to get safely away. 

Use: Hungry wyverns are known to swoop in and carry off livestock and travelers near a particular road or field. A gang of crafty bandits has managed to train a couple of wyverns as mounts and use them as flying cavalry for their troops on the ground.

 Loot: Wyverns do not collect treasure, but their nest might have a few cyphers from previous victims. If carefully extracted, an intact venom gland from a dead wyvern can be used to poison one weapon (if sold, it is the equivalent of an expensive item).

SCIENCE FICTION CREATURES AND NPCs

The most important element of each creature is its level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack or defend against the opponent. In each entry, the difficulty number for the creature is listed in parentheses after its level. The target number is three times the level. 

A creature’s target number is usually also its health, which is the amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) 8 (24)

If a supercomputer can think independently, it’s a strong AI (an artificial intelligence). Though not as advanced as godminds, AIs can develop inscrutable goals. 

AIs take many forms. Some are distributed across a vast network. Others are encoded into a singular “computer core.” A few are machines with organic parts. All are entities of extreme intelligence able to adapt to new situations, and most act on some kind of plan, whether long-acting, or newly concocted to fit the situation at hand. 

Motive: Varies 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 33 

Damage Inflicted: 10 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Immediate 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 2, knowledge tasks as level 9 

Combat: An electrical discharge—or in some cases precisely pulsed sequences of lights, each designed for a specific creature to see—can affect all targets within short range of the AI (or the AI’s local terminal), inflicting 10 points of damage from electricity (or 10 points of Intellect damage, which ignores Armor). 

Some AIs can take an action to absorb matter around them (such as walls, floor, equipment, unresisting living creatures, and so on), regaining 5 points of health. 

An AI is likely able to deploy cyphers and artifacts in combat and also relies on guardians (such as synthetic people made to its own design) to aid it. Unless a particular AI uses a computer core, damage to an AI may just be damage done to a “terminal,” so even if an AI is seemingly destroyed, it might exist as another instance somewhere else. 

Interaction: Some AIs enjoy negotiation. Others simply ignore humans as unworthy of their time and attention. An AI’s voice often sounds surprisingly human. 

Use: The characters are contacted by an AI sympathetic to biological beings. It wants them to accomplish a task on a moon of Jupiter: assassinate a security officer who the AI calculates as being a nexus of future disaster if he isn’t removed from the equation. 

Loot: An AI might have access to 1d6 cyphers and possibly an artifact or two.

CYBRID 8 (24)

Cybrid origins could be the result of someone finding a cache of ancient ultra technology, or manufactured by a post-singularity AI for some unfathomable purpose, or even the result of banned weapons research by a nation-state or conglomerate. The human remnants in each cybrid’s carbon fiber and nested shells of nanotech exist in a red haze of pain; neuro-wetware and chemicals bathing their remaining living tissues hold the pain partly at bay. 

From the exterior, not much of the original human is obvious, except perhaps in the echo of a humanoid shape. Each one has a unique conformation, but all are designed to strike fear in anyone seeing one, ally and enemy alike. 

Motive: Kill away the pain 

Environment: Usually set to guard important areas, creatures, or objects, or deployed in war 

Health: 60 

Damage Inflicted: 10 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short; flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an autonomous level 5 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules. 

Combat: Cybrids can attack up to three foes that they can see up to about 300 m (1,000 feet) away as a single action with graser (gamma ray laser) beams, inflicting 10 points of damage on each target and everything in immediate range of the target. Those caught in the beam who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 2 points of damage. If the cybrid focuses on a single target, treat the attack as a level 10 attack that inflicts 14 points of damage, or 6 points even on a successful Speed defense roll.

 Self-repair mechanisms allow the creature to regain 2 points of health per round. 

Interaction: If communication can be opened up through a cybrid’s haze of pain, it might be possible to temporarily wake the consciousness of the human remnant inside. However, that remnant consciousness might not be happy to discover what it’s become. 

Use: A cybrid has appeared in orbit around the station, ship, or moon with a compromised life support system or fragile dome. If it engages, the death toll will be staggering. 

Loot: PCs who investigate the inert remains of the creature discover several manifest cyphers.

DEVOLVED 4 (12)

Conglomerate security subsidiaries regularly experiment with new ways to create super-soldiers, either to supply to a government on a contract basis, or to use for themselves. These experiments produced hundreds of dead ends—literally—plus a few dangerous failures. The devolved are one of those dangerous failures. These malformed, hideous brutes share a common heritage but display a wide array of maladies and mutations in the flesh, including withered limbs or elephantine patches of thick, scaly skin, misplaced body parts, and mental abnormalities. Simple-minded and afflicted with pain from their twisted, broken forms, the devolved vent all their hatred and wrath against all others. 

Even successfully created super-soldiers require a regular regimen of specialized drugs to keep them healthy. Most are shipped out to fight on faraway fronts, whether that’s on a distant space station, moon, or in another star system entirely. Without their drugs, they may devolve.

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Groups of three to five, usually in locations where organized security can’t easily reach 

Health: 21 Damage Inflicted: 6 to 12 points 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Intimidation tasks as level 6; Intellect defense and Speed defense as level 2 due to malformed nature 

Combat: Devolved attack with a claw, a bite, or some other body part, inflicting 6 points of damage. They throw themselves at their enemies with mindless ferocity and little regard for their own safety. Easily frustrated, a devolved grows stronger as its fury builds. Each time it misses with an attack, the next attack is eased by one additional step and the damage it inflicts increases by 2 points (to a maximum of 12 points). Once the devolved successfully inflicts damage on a target, the amount of damage it inflicts and the difficulty of its attacks returns to normal. Then the cycle starts anew. 

Interaction: Devolved speak when they must, punctuating their statements with growls and barks. Their understanding seems limited to what they can immediately perceive, and they have a difficult time with abstract concepts. 

Use: An expedition to a ruined conglomerate research facility uncovers a cyst of devolved that live within its sheltering bunkers. 

Loot: For every three or so devolved, one is likely to carry a cypher.

ECOPHAGIC SWARM 4 (12)

Tiny nanomachines can be incredibly useful tools. But they can also become a terrible threat. Like cells in a living body that develop cancer, these out-of-control self-replicating robots can consume everything in their path while building more of themselves. A typical swarm is about 6 m (20 feet) in diameter, individually consisting of millions of individual minuscule machines. However, several swarms can act together, creating a much larger cloud of death with just one purpose: to eat and replicate. Able to move large distances by gliding through the air, cloud-like swarms take on intriguing shapes and ripple with mathematical patterns as they approach a potential target, beautiful and deadly. 

Ecophagic swarms sometimes build weird structures or artifacts in the wake of their feeding, like massive metallic ant or wasp mounds, or something without any reference at all in the natural world.

Motive: Hungers for matter, including flesh 

Environment: Ecophagic swarms are drawn most to areas rich in rare-earth metals, such as large cities or space stations where everyone carries a smartphone, AR glasses, or something similar 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Flies a long distance 

Combat: As a mass of countless tiny machines, an ecophagic swarm can flow around obstacles and squeeze through cracks large enough to permit a single sub-millimeter machine. That includes over and around other creatures. Characters touched by a leading edge—or wholly enveloped within the hazy “body”—of an ecophagic swarm must succeed on a Might defense task or take 4 points of damage. If the character doesn’t wear armor of some kind, they take 1 point of damage even if they succeed. 

For its part, an ecophagic swarm ignores any attack that targets a single creature (unless it’s an electrical attack), but it takes normal damage from attacks that affect an area (and electrical attacks), such as a detonation. A swarm cannot enter liquids, unless it takes about an hour to build new subunits that are aquatic. 

Interaction: Someone with an ability to communicate with machines might be able to interact with a swarm. Even then, attempts to influence it are hindered by three steps. 

Use: A promising new nanotech “printing” technology was hacked by radical elements.

EXOSLIME 6 (18)

Amoeboid life predominates in some environments. Sometimes, it slimes asteroid crevices or its greasy residue is found on abandoned spacecraft. In a few cases, large portions of entire worlds are covered in living seas of translucent protoplasm. Individual volumes of exoslime are 5 m (15 foot) diameter moldlike blobs. Exoslimes possess independent minds, but in some settings may be manufactured entities designed to explore new locations, interact with aliens, or subjugate aliens. Exoslimes can learn to respect the autonomy of other creatures, though their natural instinct is to absorb novel objects and creatures they discover in order to learn about them. Exoslimes can also replicate anything they absorb, even a previously eaten living intelligent being. 

Motive: Hungers for information 

Environment: Moist and warm areas 

Health: 33 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Immediate; immediate when climbing or burrowing 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size 

Combat: Though slow, an exoslime is dangerous. When roused, all characters within immediate range of an exoslime must succeed on a Might defense roll each round or be touched by the heaving mass. A victim adheres to the slime’s surface and takes 6 points of acid damage each round. The victim must succeed on a Might defense roll to pull free. A victim who dies from this damage is consumed by the exoslime. The exoslime may later create a duplicate of any previously devoured fleshy creature, a process requiring about three rounds to complete. Duplicates have full autonomy, and can communicate with the slime. 

Interaction: An exoslime prefers to eat a newly-encountered creature, then create a duplicate of it to act as a translator. Of course, a stranger might not understand why the exoslime is trying to eat it. 

Use: The sample brought in from the exterior has a weird, mucus-like growth that seems able to slowly eat through most materials.

GODMIND 10 (30)

Unfathomably powerful post-singularity AIs, godminds are vast, having used the matter of an entire solar system and all its planets to create an immense brain, weave themselves into a nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence light-years across. When necessary, a godmind forms a nexus of consciousness—an instance—appearing as a disembodied eye of electromagnetic energy, ranging from about the size of a human eye all the way up to the size of a planet. 

Motive: Ineffable 

Environment: Anywhere, usually in space 

Health: 50 (per instance) 

Damage Inflicted: 15 points 

Movement: Very long when flying 

Combat: A godmind can vary the physical laws of the universe within a light-second of one of its instances (some would call them avatars) to create an effect most useful to the godmind at the time. For instance, a godmind could create a gamma ray burst inflicting 15 points of damage on all creatures within very long range, attempt to put a target into temporal stasis, send a target (even a target as large as spacecraft) through a temporary wormhole gate, and so on. It could also scan the memory banks of any digital machine, and possibly of any living creatures. In any event, if an instance were targeted, and successfully neutralized or even destroyed, the godmind itself isn’t harmed. An aggressor would have to find the godmind’s primeval “computer core” to destroy one, likely an epic quest in and of itself. 

Interaction: To actually get a godmind’s attention and negotiate could require ancient command code, finding an old input device, or showing up with a relic from an ancient ultra or other prize. If a godmind does render aid, it’s likely to be in a form that is initially enigmatic, though ultimately extremely powerful. 

Use: A universal threat requires a defense that is equally potent. Research suggests that the diffuse nebula known as the Double Helix may actually be the visible form of a vast godmind. Perhaps it can help.

Loot: Sometimes a godmind provides powerful artifacts to aid those who petition them for aid, assuming the need is dire.

## HUNGRY HAZE

Hungry hazes are found in regions where the fundamental laws of physics have been eroded or are weak. They are named for how they appear as distortions of sight, like areas of heat haze, that shimmer in the air. These colorless hazes rapidly advance when they sense prey, taking on a “hungry” orange-red hue as they cling to the bodies of whatever they attempt to feed on next. 

Victims being fed upon by a hungry haze sometimes hallucinate, seeing a physically manifest monster instead of formless vapor.

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Alone or in groups of three to five, usually in areas of strained space-time. Immune to the effects of vacuum. 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: Flies an immediate distance each round 

Modifications: Stealth tasks as level 5 

Combat: A hungry haze breaks down the flesh of all living creatures within immediate range, inflicting 5 points of damage. As an insubstantial haze, only attacks that affect an area have a chance to inflict full damage on them; other successful attacks only inflict 1 point of damage, regardless of the amount indicated. If a hungry haze successfully feeds, it gains 1 point of health, even if the increase puts it above its maximum health. If a hungry haze is reduced to zero health, a smooth thumb-sized egg of unknown material is left behind. 

Interaction: A hungry haze does not speak or seem to have language. But it is not mindless; it can learn from its experiences and figure out creative solutions to problems. 

Use: After a research station on Mercury is abandoned for unspecified issues, salvagers show up looking for easy pickings. But a strange haze seems to hang over the station. 

Loot: People (or AI) interested in strange manifestations would probably pay for the remains of a hungry haze in an amount equal to the expensive price category.

INFOVORE 3 (9)

Entities of information with an affinity for technology, infovores are nothing but stored information without a bit of mechanism to inhabit. But once one gains control of a device, computer system, or other powered item, it self-assembles over the course of a few rounds, becoming stronger and more dangerous as each second passes. Luckily, an infovore seems unable to hold this form for long, and whether defeated or not, it eventually falls back into so much scattered junk. But in one of those objects, the core of the infovore remains, waiting to come into close enough proximity to another fresh mechanism to begin the rebirth process again. 

Infovores have also been called ghost fabricators and aterics

Motive: Hungers for information 

Environment: Anywhere powered devices are found 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 3–10 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Attacks and defends at an ever-escalating level 

Combat: A newly animate infovore (level 3) has a rough but articulated form that it uses to batter and cut targets who carry powered devices on them. Unless destroyed, on each subsequent round it draws nearby inert mechanisms, unattended metallic and synthetic matter, and ambient energy, and its effective level increases by one. This level advancement completely heals all previous damage it has taken and advances it to the amount of health consistent with a creature of the next higher level. Damage, attacks, and defense continue to ramp up as well, continuing each round until the creature is either destroyed or it reaches level 10. After being active for one round at level 10, it spontaneously disassembles, falling back into so many scattered pieces of junk. Finding the “seed” device amid this junk is a difficulty 6 Intellect-based task. 

Interaction: Infovores are fractured, fragmented beings. Characters who can talk to machines might be able to keep one from “spinning up” to become a threat and learn something valuable, but only for a short period. 

Use: Among the devices collected from trade, salvage, archeological dig, or some other unique source, one was actually an inactive infovore, quiescent until plugged in or scanned. 

Loot: An infovore that has undergone spontaneous disassembly leaves one or two manifest cyphers; however, there’s a chance that one of those cyphers is actually the infovore seed.

INQUISITOR 4 (12)

Inquisitors are aliens who call themselves “inquisitors” when they contact new species. Their preferred method of interaction is to study a given area for its flora and fauna, and attempt to collect a representative sample of any intelligent species they find (such as humans). Collected subjects may be gone for good, but other times they wake with little or no recollection of the experience save for bruises, missing digits or teeth, scabbed-over circular head wounds, and a gap of three or more days in their memory. Instead of arms, inquisitors sprout three sets of three tentacles like those of a squid, each of which branches into a smaller and finer set of manipulator tendrils. They can manipulate complex machines in a way that a regular human could never hope to. In most settings, inquisitors possess a level of technology and advancement well above that enjoyed by humans. 

Motive: Knowledge 

Environment: In groups of three to twelve 

Health: 18 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing 

Modifications: Knowledge-related tasks as level 8 

Combat: Inquisitors can batter and squeeze foes with their tentacles, but they prefer to use advanced items that they always carry, including long-range energy weapons that can inflict damage or, with a flipped setting, induce deep sleep for an hour or more if the victim fails a Might defense task. Usually, inquisitors attempt to cause as little damage as possible to potential subjects, so the sleep setting is used most often. They also carry defensive items, including manifest cyphers that can grant +4 to Armor for a few minutes or throw up a level 8 force field barrier. In case a specimen collection mission goes badly, at least one inquisitor carries a manifest cypher that creates a short-lived teleportation portal for instant transport to a distant and hidden base (which might be a spacecraft or a transdimensional redoubt). 

Interaction: Inquisitors are always eager to “talk,” though they usually end up wanting to know a lot more than characters are willing to divulge. 

Use: An entire freehold on Mars goes missing. Left-behind clues point to inquisitors. 

Loot: Most inquisitors carry a couple of manifest cyphers that have offensive and defensive capabilities.

MALWARE, FATAL 4 (12)

This purely malefic program has aggressive machine learning capabilities, allowing it to accomplish truly innovative and nasty tricks. Fatal malware may have originated as a simple virus or spyware coded for a specific purpose, but corruption and lightning-quick electronic evolution has turned it into something that exists purely to infect orderly electronic systems, spacecraft, space stations, smart weapons, and anything else with an operating system. Infected objects turn against living people. An instance often has the form of the system it’s infected, but occasionally fatal malware physically manifests as a metallic “cancer” of wires and self-assembling circuits hanging like a tumor across a server room, shipmind core, or data center, having perverted the original machine’s self-repair functions. Sometimes 4D printers are also compromised. 

Motive: Corruption and destruction 

Environment: Any electronic system able to run code can host one or more instances 

Health: 18 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: As the system it infects 

Modifications: Knowledge tasks related to computers and other electronic systems as level 6 

Combat: An instance of fatal malware that physically touches (or electrically connects with) a powered device of up to level 6 can attempt to seize control of it. It can then use that device to attack living targets. If the controlled system is a computer, smartphone, AR glasses, or some other piece of equipment that doesn’t have any intrinsic movement, the malware attempts to electrocute a user, or if a smart weapon, cause some kind of fatal accident with it. A compromised computer or shipmind voice can dangerously mislead victims. Fatal malware duplicates itself, creating many instances, and those that survive are usually slightly better at avoiding being erased than the previous generations. 

Interaction: Fatal malware isn’t really sentient and thus can’t really be negotiated with; some instances could mimic intelligence to draw humans into a trap. 

Use: An instance of fatal malware has gotten into a shipmind, which is making the normally trustworthy AI act out in unexpectedly dangerous ways. The shipmind itself doesn’t know it’s infected.

MOCK ORGANISM 3 (9)

Artificial life can be created by selective breeding, synthetic and genetic engineering, or by accidental miscalculation in some unrelated high-energy or food-research program. When artificial life takes a wrong turn, the results run the gamut from disappointing to dangerous. If an artificial entity starts out benign, it’s difficult to know if a hidden or slowly developing flaw will tip it over the edge into dangerous dysfunction—or if it just acts oddly because it doesn’t know the social cues. Should synthetic beings be treated as people, pets, or monsters to be stamped out and destroyed? That’s the eternal question and one that’s usually answered by those most afraid of potential dangers that might accompany the creation of something no one intended. 

Motive: Defense or destruction 

Environment: Usually in secluded locations alone unless hiding in unused storage rooms of a large facility 

Health: 18 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short 

Combat: A mock organism can release an electrical discharge against a target at short range. In melee, a mock organism’s poisoned claws inflict damage and require the target to succeed on a Might defense task, or the poison induces a coma-like slumber in the target. Each round the target fails to rouse—an Intellect task—they take 3 points of ambient damage. 

Interaction: A mock organism is intelligent and can sometimes be swayed by reason. It might be passive, but if disturbed in a place it thought was secure against intrusion, it could grow belligerent and even murderous. Once so roused, a mock organism might still be calmed, but all such attempts are hindered. 

Use: A scientist’s ruined lab contains several unexpected surprises, including a mock organism that yet grieves over the loss of its creator. 

Loot: A mock organism requires many parts. Salvage from a destroyed mock organism could result in a manifest cypher or two and another item that, with a bit of jury-rigging, works as an artifact. 

NATATHIM 3 (9)

Genetically engineered to live in the water oceans discovered beneath the ice crusts of various solar moons, natathim (Homo aquus) have human ancestors, but barely look it. Survival in the frigid, lightless depths of extraterrestrial oceans required extreme adaptation. Predominantly dark blue, their undersides countershade to pure white. Though humanoid, their physiology is streamlined, giving their heads a somewhat fish-like shape, complete with gills and large eyes to collect light in the depths. Their bodies are adorned with fins and frills, including a long shark-like tail, and they have webbed extremities with retractable claws. 

Depending on the setting, natathim are either human allies with the same (or even more advanced) tech, enemies with the same or more advanced tech, or genetic anomalies treated like laboratory rats burning with genocidal fury at what’s been done to them. Alternatively, natathim could be discovered in Earth’s deepest oceans, their origin mysterious, but able to interbreed with humans as a method for maintaining their line. 

Motive: Just as with humans, natathim have many and varied motivations and drives. 

Environment: Anywhere in or near water, or in suits/craft with marine environments, in schools of three to twelve. Natathim can act normally in air for up to twenty-four hours before they must return to water. 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short on land; long in the water 

Modifications: Swims as level 6 

Combat: Natathim attack with their retractable claws or, if available, technological weapons. Some have a magnetoreception ability that allows them to see into frequencies other creatures can’t, or even stranger abilities to interact magnetically with their surroundings, though this is little understood. 

Interaction: Natathim can be sympathetic to humans, partners in space exploration, or consider humans to be bitter foes for having created their species in the first place, depending on the setting. 

Use: The PCs find evidence of an illegal gene tailoring experiment, with evidence pointing to research being done somewhere in the Opulence of Outer Planets. 

Loot: Some natathim carry valuable items and equipment.

OMWORWAR 10 (30)

Among the many stories passed down the space lanes, a few stand out for their grandiosity. Take the tales of omworwar sightings in the empty voids between stars, or even more unexpectedly, flashing through the abnormal space during FTL travel. Scientists speculate that these creatures, if actually real, might very well be extant instances of ancient ultras, not extinct as everyone believes, or at least not completely. In almost every case so far recorded, omworwars have little interest in human spacecraft. (They’re called omworwar after the sound disrupted communication devices make in their presence.) Each one is several kilometers long, a dark inner slug-like core surrounded by gauzy layers of translucent, glowing, nebula-like tissue. Whale-like eyes surmount the dorsal surface, each seeming to contain a tiny galaxy all their own. 

Wharn interceptors have been seen accompanying single omworwars, indicating an association, and is why some people refer to these beings as wharn cogitators.

Motive: Unpredictable 

Environment: Almost anywhere in space, alone or accompanied by one or two wharn interceptors 

Health: 42 

Damage Inflicted: 12 points 

Armor: 10 

Movement: Flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an autonomous level 7 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules. FTL capable. 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 7 due to size 

Combat: An omworwar can manipulate and fold gravity (and space-time), allowing them to accomplish near-miraculous tasks including communication, creating or destroying matter, and propulsion via “falling” through the universe at FTL speeds from the perspective of an outside observer. Which means one can rend a spacecraft, send a spacecraft spinning through the galaxy, or create asteroid-sized chunks of space-matter for any number of purposes if it spends several rounds in deep concentration. 

Interaction: Omworwar disregard most other creatures, because from the omworwar’s perspective, they’re like mayflies, here and then gone again in an eyeblink of their existence. However, one may give a moment to someone who has discovered an ancient ultra secret or artifact, pass on information that might otherwise never be known, or even provide a useful manifest cypher. 

Use: A reflective object composed of unknown material was found at the core of an unexpectedly destroyed space station. Those who managed to flee in lifeboats report having seen what might have been an omworwar, bleeding energy and eyes going dark, colliding with the station. The resultant lump might just be its corpse, or maybe its protective chrysalis. 

Loot: Four level 10 manifest cyphers.

PHOTONOMORPH 6 (18)

Hard-light technology, which creates pseudo-matter from modified photons, has made possible all kinds of structures and devices that wouldn’t otherwise exist. One of those, unfortunately, are self-sustaining photonic matter creatures. Sometimes, photonomorphs are enforcers created by much more powerful beings; other times they are the result of some person or AI attempting to ascend into a new state of being. But whatever their origin, photonomorphs are dangerous beings that can create matter from light, granting them an arbitrarily wide swathe of abilities. That includes their own glowing bodies, which they can change with only a little effort. This variability of form, coupled with their vast power, may be why many seem slightly mad. 

Motive: Varies 

Environment: Anywhere, alone or attended by three to five servitors appearing as hovering red spheres 

Health: 22 

Damage Inflicted: 8 points 

Armor: 3 

Movement: Reconstitutes itself anywhere light can reach within long range as part of another action 

Modifications: Knowledge tasks as level 8 

Combat: Photonomorphs draw upon their own light to manifest effects equal to their level. Effects include the ability to attack creatures at long range with laser-like blasts, create glowing walls (or spheres) of force within an area up to 6 m (20 feet) on a side, become invisible, change its appearance, and create simple objects and devices out of hard light that last for about a minute (unless the photonomorph bleeds a few points of its health into the object to make it last until destroyed). 

A photonomorph regains 2 points of health each round in areas of bright light. It is hindered in all actions if the only source of light is itself or objects it has created. 

Interaction: Photonomorphs are intelligent and paranoid, but not automatically hostile. They have their own self-serving agendas, which often involve elaborate schemes. 

Use: A photonomorph appears, claiming to be a herald of some vastly more powerful cosmic entity or approaching alien vessel.

POSTHUMAN 7 (21)

Rather than evolving naturally, posthumans advance via a directed jump, designed with smart tools and AI surgeons. With all the advances fantastic technology brings to their genetic upgrade, posthumans are beings whose basic capacities radically exceed regular people. They can’t really be considered human any longer; they’ve transcended humanity, which is why they’re also sometimes called transhumans. They’re often involved in large-scale projects, such as creating bigger-than-world habitats or spacecraft, or possibly even researching how they might ascend to some still-higher realm of consciousness or being. 

Motive: Variable 

Environment: Alone or in small groups or communities in orbital colonies or other designed locations 

Health: 50 

Damage Inflicted: 9 points 

Armor: 4 

Movement: Short; flies a long distance 

Modifications: Knowledge tasks as level 9 

Combat: Posthumans can selectively attack foes up to a very long distance away with bolts of directed plasma that deal 9 points of damage. A posthuman can dial up the level of destruction if they wish, so instead of affecting only one target, a bolt deals 7 points of damage to all targets within short range of the primary target, and 1 point even if the targets caught in the conflagration succeed on a Speed defense roll. 

Posthumans can also call on a variety of other abilities, either by small manipulations of the quantum field or by deploying nanotechnology. Essentially, a posthuman can mimic the ability of any subtle cypher of level 5 or less as an action. 

Posthumans automatically regain 2 points of health per round while its health is above 0. 

Interaction: Posthumans are so physically and mentally powerful that they are almost godlike to unmodified people, and either ignore, care for, or pity them. Knowing what a posthuman actually wants is hard to pin down because their motivations are complex and many-layered. 

Use: A rogue posthuman is researching a method whereby they might portal into the “quantum” realm of dark energy underlying the known universe of normal matter. Despite the revealed risk of antagonistic post-singularity AIs roaming that realm escaping, the posthuman continues their work. 

Loot: The body of a posthuman is riddled with unrecognizable technologies fused seamlessly with residual organic material—or at least material that grows like organic material used to. Amid this, it might be possible to salvage a few manifest cyphers and an artifact.

REDIVUS 4 (12)

Redivi spend most of their lives—uncounted millennia—hurtling through space. Most never encounter anything, but some few impact other worlds, are captured by alien spacecraft, or otherwise intercepted. Their traveling form resembles rocky space rubble the size of a small spacecraft—until they unfurl glowing magnetic plasma wings, revealing themselves as strange creatures of living mineral. Redivi can interact with almost any electronic system and manipulate electromagnetic fields. Redivi are searchers, all sent forth by the Great Mother, billions upon billions of them (they say), looking for the seed of the next great cosmic expansion. Thus, most redivi are consumed with finding out more, finding other redivi, and eventually, finding their “universal seed.” 

Motive: Knowledge 

Environment: Almost anywhere, searching 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 4 

Movement: Flies (magnetically levitates) a short distance each round 

Combat: The stone carapace of a redivus makes a huge “club” when it rams into foes. However, it can also control metal within short range, causing it to flex, animate, crush, or smash. For instance, targets wearing metal space suits are in trouble when that metal begins to unravel. Alternatively, a redivus can use nearby metal to wrap around a target and constrict it, inflicting 5 points of damage (ignores Armor) each round until the target can escape. 

Interaction: If any kind of radio or similar communication is in use, these creatures can commandeer it and speak through it, learning a new language seemingly over the course of minutes. Redivi will cooperate with reasonable requests and negotiate, especially if there’s a chance they’ll find out something new. 

Use: A redivi pod smashes into the side of the spacecraft, and might at first seem like some kind of attack or boarding action of something truly terrible.

SENTINEL TREE 3 (9)

Depending on the sci-fi setting, sentinel trees are mutated trees that grow near radioactive craters dimpling the landscape, alien plant-life that evolved in a different biosphere (or dimension), or the result of intensive gene-tailoring, possibly of the illegal sort. Regardless of their provenance, sentinel trees resemble thorny masses of knotted vines. Razor-sharp glass-like leaves flex like claws, and vibrating pods glisten, ready to detonate if thrown. If cultivated, they may take on a shape designed to further frighten—or at least warn away— those who see one. Sentinel trees are mobile, aggressive, and feed on almost any sort of organic matter. Once it brings down prey, it sinks barbed roots in the body for feeding and decomposition. 

Motive: Feed 

Environment: In groves of three to six, able to tolerate most atmospheres (even thin ones, like on Mars) but not vacuum 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Immediate 

Combat: Sentinel trees can fling a vibrating pod at a target within long range, which detonates on impact, inflicting 3 points of damage on all targets within immediate range of the blast. Targets must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be poisoned for 3 points of damage, plus 3 points again each subsequent round until a Might task is successful. A sentinel tree can also lash out with its barbed vines at a target within immediate range, inflicting 3 points of damage. Melee targets must also succeed on a Might defense roll or become entangled and unable to take physical actions until they can break free on their turn. 

Interaction: Sentinel trees are about as smart as well-trained guard dogs. They can’t speak, but can understand some words and gestures. 

Use: A grove of sentinel trees guard a compound that the characters need to break into.

SILICON PARASITE 2 (6)

These tiny silvery insect-like creatures range in size from a sub-millimeter to up to 30 cm (1 foot) in diameter, emitting short pulses of violet-colored laser light to sense and sample their environment. Composed of organic silicon wires and wafers, and self-assembled or evolved in some unnamed lab or spacecraft wreck, silicon parasites are vermin that working space stations and spacecraft have learned to hate. Despite taking steps to avoid transfer, a ship may only learn they have silicon parasites when a swarm boils up from a crack in the cabling or seam in the deck plating after being agitated by a high-G maneuver or some other disturbance. If that disturbance is combat or some other dire emergency, silicon parasites thrown into the situation makes everything worse. 

Motive: Defense, harvest electronic materials necessary to self-replicate. 

Environment: Usually on spacecraft and space stations in groups of up to twenty 

Health: 6 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short; climbs a short distance each round 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size. 

Combat: Only “large” silicon parasites are a danger to most creatures. When four or more parasites coordinate their attacks, treat the attack as that made by a single level 4 creature that inflicts 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 4 Might defense roll, an attack that holds the target in place until it can successfully escape. A held target automatically takes 5 points of damage each round, or even more if other silicon parasites in the area pile on. Silicon parasites can operate in complete vacuum without harm. 

Interaction: By and large, silicon parasites behave like social insects, though some claim that large numbers of them have acted with greater intelligence and forethought than mere unthinking insects can manage. 

Use: A swarm of silicon parasites floods into the hold and makes off with an important device, dragging it into the crevices and walls of the spacecraft or station. Loot: Swarm nests often contain a few valuable manifest cyphers or working pieces of equipment.

SPACE RAT 1 (3)

Yeah, rats made it to space. And against all expectations, one strain evolved in the harsh radiation and zero-G environments that would kill humans not protected by medical intervention. Space rats are furless, about two feet long, sport a truly prehensile tail, and can quickly change their shade of their skin to blend in to their surroundings. They can also drop into a state of extreme torpor that allows them to survive stints of vacuum exposure lasting several days. 

Space rats are vermin, and any spacecraft or space station that hosts a nest must deal with constant issues from the rats burrowing into systems, stealing food and water, and causing systems to break down, even critical ones. They’re also vicious when cornered. 

Motive: Defense, reproduction 

Environment: Anywhere humans live in space 

Health: 5 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing or gliding through zero G 

Modifications: Stealth and perception as level 5 

Combat: Space rats flee combat unless cornered or one of their burrows is invaded. Then they attack in packs of three or more, and from an ambush if possible. One space rat pack attacks the victim as a level 3 creature inflicting 5 points of damage with claws, while another pack helps the first, or attempts to steal a food item or shiny object from the character being attacked. To resist theft while being attacked on two fronts, a target must succeed on a Speed defense roll hindered by two steps. 

Interaction: Space rats are slightly more intelligent than their Earth-bound cousins, though true interaction is not possible. On the other hand, sometimes their behavior seems spookily sapient. 

Use: Space rats assemble crude nests in out-of-the-way supply closets or in hard-to-reach system interiors, but often enough, end up shorting out weapons or life support. Sometimes, they get into the hold and eat anything edible in the cargo. 

Loot: Some percent of valuable equipment stolen on the spacecraft or station finds its way to space rat nests.

STORM MARINE 4 (12)

The storm marine creed is an oft-repeated mantra, “I will never quit, knowing full well that I might die in service to the cause.” Wearing advanced battlesuits, hyped up on a cocktail of experimental military drugs, and able to draw on a suite of cybernetic and network-connected drone guns, few things can stand before a storm marine fireteam. Storm marines usually work for nation-states, conglomerates, and similar entities. They mercilessly conduct their mission, even if that mission is to wipe out a rival. Storm marines that question their orders are quickly dispatched by their fellows. 

Motive: Achieve mission goals 

Environment: Alone in or in fireteams of three, anywhere nation-states or similar entities have a financial or military interest 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Armor: 4 

Movement: Long; flies a long distance each round 

Modifications: Perception as level 6; attacks as level 5 due to combat targeting neuro-wetware. 

Combat: Thanks to their battlesuit, a storm marine has many options in combat. They can deploy an electrified blade to attack every foe in immediate range as a single action, or use a long-range heavy energy rifle that inflicts 6 points of damage. 

A storm marine can deploy two level 3 gun drones that fire energy rays at two different targets up to 800 m (2,600 feet) away, inflicting 6 points of damage. If the drones focus on a single target, a successful hit deals 9 points of damage and moves the target one step down the damage track. The drones can attack only once or twice before returning to their cradles in the storm marine’s suit for several rounds to recharge. 

Interaction: A storm marine might negotiate, but getting one to act against their mission is difficult. 

Use: A fireteam of storm marines are sent to eliminate the PCs or someone the PCs know on suspicion of being radical elements that need to be dealt with. 

Loot: Though bio-locked to each storm marine, someone who succeeds on a difficulty 8 Intellect task to reprogram the suit could gain a battlesuit of their own, minus the drones (which fly off or detonate).

SHINING ONE 5 (15)

Some alien beings abandoned their physical forms millennia ago, becoming entities of free-floating energy and pure consciousness. They travel the galaxies, exploring the endless permutations of matter, space-time, cosmic phenomena, dark energy, and life. They are endlessly fascinated with the permutations they discover. They sometimes appear as a silhouette of gently glowing light, in a form like to the alien species they wish to observe. Under circumstances where a shining one is moved to more directly interact, one can actually convert itself into matter once more, again taking on the biology and form of the species it wishes to interact with. But generally, shining ones observe and learn; they try not to interfere or interact. Every few thousand years, shining ones gather at a predetermined location on the edge of a convenient galaxy and share the most interesting and beautiful bits of imagery, music, poetry, and lore they’ve gleaned. 

Motive: Knowledge 

Environment: Anywhere, usually alone 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Instantly moves to anywhere it can see at the speed of light as part of its action once per round

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge as level 8 

Combat: As immaterial beings of energy, shining ones only take damage from energy attacks. And even then, there is a chance that the energy heals a damaged shining one rather than harming it if the attack roll was an odd number. Usually a shining one doesn’t fight back if attacked, but instead leaves. If somehow prevented from leaving, a shining one fights for its existence with energy blasts inflicting 6 points of damage on up to two different targets within very long range (or the same target twice). 

Alternatively, a shining one may attempt to discorporate a target, turning it into a being something like itself. In this case, each time a target is hit by an energy blast, it must also succeed on an Intellect defense roll. On a failed roll, it loses 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). If the target’s Intellect Pool is emptied, it becomes a freefloating ball of energy unable to take any actions other than observe for a few minutes before suddenly converting back to its original form with an explosive pop. 

Interaction: Shining ones can manipulate their environment to communicate with other species, using sound, light, puffs of odiferous complex chemicals in place of words, and so on. If approached with respect, they freely exchange information with others, seeking to grow their knowledge and that of those they meet. 

Use: A shining one is sharing knowledge to a warlike xenophobic species that could allow them to rapidly advance their ability to consolidate power. Something must be done before it’s too late.

SUPERNAL 5 (15)

Half humanoid and half-dragonfly, supernals are beautiful entities, though certainly alien. Each supernal possesses a unique wing pattern and coloration and, to some extent, body shape. These patterns and colors may signify where in the hierarchy a particular supernal stands among its kind, but for those who do not speak the language of supernals (which is telepathic), the complexity of their social structure is overwhelming. Whether they are agents of some unknown alien civilization or seek their own aims, supernals are mysterious and cryptic. Most fear contact with them, because they have a penchant for stealing away other life forms, who are rarely seen again. 

Motive: Capture humans and similar life forms, and bring them somewhere unknown. 

Environment: Almost anywhere 

Health: 23 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Short; flies a long distance (even through airless vacuum); can teleport to any known location once per ten hours as an action 

Modifications: All knowledge tasks as level 6; stealth tasks as level 7 while invisible 

Combat: Supernals usually only enter combat when they wish, because they bide their time in a phased, invisible state. But when one attacks with the touch of its wing, it draws the life force directly out of the target, inflicting 6 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). 

A supernal can summon a swarm of tiny machines that resemble regular dragonflies made of golden metal. The swarm either serves as a fashion accessory as they crawl over the supernal’s body, or as components in a piece of living art. 

Supernals regain 1 point of health per round (even in an airless vacuum, which they can survive without issue), unless they’ve been damaged with psychic attacks. They can teleport to any location they know as an action once every ten hours. 

Supernals often carry manifest cyphers useful in combat, as well as an artifact. 

Dragonfly swarm: level 2; flies a long distance each round; eases physical tasks, including attacks or defense

Interaction: Although supernals only speak telepathically, peaceful interaction with these creatures is not impossible. It’s just very difficult, as they see most other creatures as something to be collected and taken to some undisclosed location, for unknown reasons. 

Use: A character is followed by a supernal intent on collecting them. Loot: A supernal usually has a few manifest cyphers, and possibly an artifact.

SYNTHETIC PERSON 5 (15)

Synthetic people have been called many things, including simply synths, androids, robot mimics, and, depending on how they act, killer robots. Their origins are varied. In some cases, they’re the result of corporate research into “products” that would serve humanity as assistants and companions, but later gained sentience. In other cases, synthetic people are the result of a state-sponsored program to develop war machines or automated assassins that looked like regular people. Another origin for synthetic people is through the design of awakened (and inimical) AIs as part of an effort to kill off all regular biological people. Now they roam their environment looking like anyone else. Some synths try to fit into whatever kind of society they can find. Some may not even know that they are not human. Others are bitter, homicidal, or still retain their programming to kill. Some of these may have even shed some or all of their synthetic skins to reveal the alloyed mechanisms beneath. 

Motive: Varies 

Environment: Nearly anywhere, out in plain sight or disguised as a human alone, or in gangs of three to four 

Health: 24 

Damage Inflicted: 7 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Long 

Modifications: Disguise and one knowledge task as level 6 

Combat: A punch from a synthetic person can break bones. In addition, some synths (especially of the killer variety) can generate a red-hot plasma sphere once every other round and throw it at a target within long range. The target and all other creatures within immediate range of the target must succeed on a Speed defense task or take 7 points of damage. 

A synth can take a repair action and regain 10 points of health. A synthetic person at 0 health can’t repair itself thusly, but unless the creature is completely dismembered, one may spontaneously reanimate 1d10 hours later with 4 points of health. 

Interaction: Synthetic people that pretend to be (or think that they are) human interact like normal people. But an enraged one or one that’s been programmed to kill is unreasoning and fights to the end. 

Use: A group of refugees who need help turn out to include (or be entirely made up of) synthetic people. Whether or not any of them harbor programs that require that they kill humans is entirely up to the GM. 

Loot: One or two manifest cyphers could be salvaged from a synth’s inactive form.

THUNDERING BEHEMOTH 7 (21)

When life is found on other worlds, it’s sometimes large and dangerous, such as the aptly named thundering behemoth. A thundering behemoth might be found on any number of alien planets that feature forests and/or swamps. Towering to treelike heights, these fearless predators are powerful and dangerous hunters, even for those armed with advanced or fantastic weaponry. Behemoths use color-changing frills to help them appear like tall trees while they stand in wait for prey, as still as mighty hardwood trunks, until they break cover and spring an ambush. Behemoths can produce extraordinarily loud noises, sometimes simply roaring, but often replicating the stuttering scream of an attacking spacecraft. They use their strange “roars” to confuse, lead astray, and, if possible, stampede prey into killing grounds such as regions of soft sand, off cliff tops, or as often as not, into the waiting mouth of another behemoth.

In the sci-fi setting of Numenera, similar creatures are called rumbling dasipelts. 

Motive: Fresh meat 

Environment: Forests, alone or in a hunting group (known as a “crash”) of two or three 

Health: 35 

Damage Inflicted: 9 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Disguise (as trees) as level 8 when unmoving. Deception (sounding as if an attacking spacecraft) as level 8. Speed defense as level 3 due to size. 

Combat: A thundering behemoth can attack a group of creatures (within an immediate area of each other) with a single massive bite. Thanks to its long neck, it can make that attack up to 9 m (30 feet) away. One victim must further succeed on a Might defense task or be caught in the creature’s maw, taking 9 additional points of damage each round until it can escape. 

A thundering behemoth’s ability to replicate threatening noises is often used deceptively at a distance, but the creature can use it to stun all targets within immediate range so they lose their next turn on a failed Might defense roll. 

Interaction: Behemoths have a complex communication system among themselves, using their color-changing frills and modulation of the thunder they produce. They think of humans and most other creatures as food. 

Use: The sound of fighting spacecraft has repeatedly spooked human colonists on an alien planet, though they have rarely seen destructive beams or actual spacecraft. Worried that that will soon change, the residents ask the PCs to investigate.

VACUUM FUNGUS 5 (15)

Vacuum fungus is sometimes found as a greenish ooze on the exterior of spacecraft or space stations, growing in fine lines through the ice of frozen moons, and infesting the center of small asteroids and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Though able to survive in vacuum, the fungus takes on new morphology when sufficient spores find their way into habitable zero-G spaces. Then they fuse together and grow into a bulbous, emerald-hued fruiting body, typically reaching about 1 m (3 feet) in rough diameter, though individuals can grow much larger if not discovered. Sticky and soft to the touch, they are able to grow undetected in the dark corners of cargo holds, in ductworks, hanging from the ceiling of unused crew quarters, and so on. 

Vacuum fungus may be proof that extra-terrestrial life exists, but that triumph of scientific discovery may seem less important to those who find a clump, because they are incredibly toxic to living creatures. 

Motive: Reproduction 

Environment: Anywhere in zero G, as an unreactive ooze in vacuum, or as a fruiting body in atmosphere, alone or in a cluster of three to five 

Health: 22 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Climbs (adheres) an immediate distance each round 

Combat: A fruiting body can selectively detonate spore pods along its surface once per round. When a pod detonates, green fluid sprays everywhere within immediate range. Living creatures who fail a Speed defense roll take 6 points of damage from the clinging fluid. An affected target must also succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failure, an affected section of flesh rapidly swells, becoming a bilious green lump, and explodes one round later, having the same effect as a detonating pod. 

Interaction: No real interaction with vacuum fungus is possible. 

Use: Scientists are incredibly excited to discover that the strange ooze they’ve noticed staining the exterior of their research domes is actually a variety of fungal life. They will likely become less excited when they discover the large growths secretly growing in the cavity beneath the floor of their research dome in a little-used storage closet.

WHARN INTERCEPTOR 8 (24)

Wharn interceptors are void-adapted behemoths, several hundred meters in length. It’s hypothesized that they are living battle automatons devised by ancient ultras, though against what long-vanished enemy isn’t clear. Now, a handful (hopefully no more) glide through the depths of space like dormant seeds, seeming for all the galaxy like some strangely whorled asteroid or planetesimal. Who knows how many millennia they passed in this apparently hibernating state? But when that hibernation ends, maybe because some ancient countdown is nearing its end, or because an asteroid miner tried to extract a sample, they open eyes burning with deadly energy, and flex claws of particle-beam fury. 

Wharn interceptors may be related in some fashion omworwars, so much so that humans sometimes call the latter “wharn cogitators.” However, it’s impossible that omworwars simply “appropriate” any wharn interceptors they encounter. 

Motive: Defense 

Environment: Anywhere floating through the void 

Health: 53 

Damage Inflicted: 15 points 

Armor: 5 

Movement: Flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an autonomous level 5 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules. FTL capable. 

Modification: Speed defense as level 3 due to size. 

Combat: Most of the time, wharns are inactive and might look like tumbling rocks. In this state, space voyagers may be able to partly wake one in an attempt to negotiate. However, if a wharn is damaged, or if the passive senses deep in its body wake it for reasons of its own, it becomes aggressive. 

A wharn’s main weapons are its claws, which can extend in an instant, becoming exotic-matter beams able to reach a target up to a light-second away. Unless a target is protected by some kind of force field, the 15 points of damage inflicted ignores Armor. A wharn’s eyes can pierce most forms of camouflage, cloaking effects, and cover that is less than about 200 m (650 feet) thick. 

Interaction: In spite of their ferocious aspect and war-machine heritage, wharn interceptors do not destroy every spacecraft (and void-adapted creature) they come across, or even most. Indeed, sometimes a wharn may attempt to initiate communication via various machine channels. But what comes across are usually nonsense sounds and tones, and sometimes mathematical formulas. 

Use: The PCs, attempting to enter an abandoned space station or spacecraft, are distracted when a wharn attempts to destroy the very same object.

WRAITH 4 (12)

Wraiths (Homo vacuus) are genetically engineered to live in the vacuum of space by directly metabolizing high-energy charged particles abundant in the void. Though derived from human stock, wraiths are alien in body, sometimes concealing themselves in layers of shroud-like tissue, other times revealing themselves as wispy, elongated things of glowing red plasma. In some settings, wraiths are partners with humans, working in locations where humans would find difficult. In other settings, wraiths went their own way generations earlier, and rediscovering them would be a first contact scenario. Alternatively, wraiths might be a threat to humans, hating humans for having created a species forced to spend its existence in the dark void of space.

Motive: Varies with individual or setting 

Environment: Anywhere in vacuum, though usually with access to some kind of enriched radiation source. Environments with 1 G or higher eventually kill wraiths. 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 6 points 

Movement: Short when flying in zero and low G 

Modifications: Perception and stealth tasks as level 7 

Combat: Wraiths can unfold from their concealing shrouds and attack with radioactive limbs for 6 points of Speed damage from ionizing radiation (ignores most Armor), or if available, technological weapons. Some can direct ionizing radiation as long-distance attacks, though doing so costs the wraith 1 point of health. Wraiths are immune to radiation, and attacks using radiation heal a wraith’s lost health by the amount of damage the attack would have otherwise afflicted. Gravity of 1 G or greater hinders all wraith actions. 

Interaction: Wraiths communicate by radio. They react to outsiders as dictated by their place in the setting. 

Use: A distant space station stops all communication. Investigators are dispatched to find out what happened. Once aboard, they unravel clues that suggest wraiths may have been responsible. 

Loot: Some wraiths carry valuable items and equipment.

ZERO-POINT PHANTOM 3 (9)

Temporary violations of conservation of energy mean that “virtual particles” constantly and seemingly randomly pop out of nothing, briefly interact with normal matter, then disappear. Zero-point phantoms are collections of such particles, taking the form of a very large, almost spider-like entity of many legs, stalks, and arms. What they’re doing when they’re not manifest is unknown; are they entombed in nearby solids, phased into another dimension, or do they simply not exist until they are called into being by some random cosmic event? Whatever the case, zero-point phantoms seem to prefer unlit or dimly lit areas in spacecraft and stations far from any planet, when they seem to struggle out of solid surfaces, raising a cloud of shadow. 

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Anywhere dark 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Movement: Short; short when climbing 

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to a cloud of shadows surrounding a zero-point phantom 

Combat: A zero-point phantom attacks with needlelike leg and tentacle tips. A victim that takes damage must succeed on a Might defense task, or become poisoned, the effect of which is to drop them one step on the damage track. The victim must keep fighting off the poison until they succeed or drop three steps on the damage track; however, those who fall to the third step on the damage track from a phantom’s poison are not dead. They are paralyzed and can’t move for about a minute. If a phantom isn’t otherwise occupied, it can grab a paralyzed victim and phase back into non-existence. Most victims phased away in this fashion are never seen again. 

Zero-point phantoms can stutter in and out of existence on their turn once every few minutes. When they do, they return with full health. 

Interaction: Zero-point phantoms are about as intelligent as predators like wolves. 

Use: The abandoned spacecraft is weirdly empty of any bodies whatsoever. It’s as if everyone just disappeared. There are signs of a struggle, though with what isn’t clear.

HORROR CREATURES AND NPCs

The creatures and NPCs in this chapter are provided to help you populate your horror game. The most important element of each creature or NPC is its level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack or defend against the opponent. In each entry, the difficulty number for the creature or NPC is listed in parentheses after its level. The target number is three times the level.

The target number is usually also its health, which is the amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, the entries always list health, even when it’s the normal amount for a creature or NPC of its level. For more detailed information on level, health, combat, and other elements, see the Understanding the Listings section in the Cypher System Rulebook.

\* Creature found in the Cypher System Rulebook

Blob 8 (24)

The huge, undulating mass of this creature is composed of a mucus-like solid. The half-amorphous blob defeats its foes by absorbing prey, integrating a victim’s tissue into its own. In essence, the victim becomes the blob, and all of the victim’s knowledge is available to the blob for later use.

If it later desires, a blob can release a nearly perfect replicant of any creature that it has absorbed. Replicants have the memories and personalities of the originals, but they do the blob’s bidding, which is usually to explore distant locations or lure prey into the open using a friendly face. A particularly well-crafted replicant might not know it’s not the original. Creating a replicant takes a blob a day or two of effort, during which time it’s unable to defend itself or eat, so it’s not a task the creature attempts lightly.

Motive: Assimilation of all flesh

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 66

Damage Inflicted: 8 points (acid gout)

Movement: Immediate; immediate when burrowing

Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to size

Combat: The blob can project a gout of acid at short range against a single target. Though slow, a blob is always moving forward. A character (or two characters next to each other) within immediate range of a blob must succeed on a Might defense roll each round or be partly caught under the heaving mass of the advancing creature. A caught victim adheres to the blob’s surface and takes 10 points of damage each round. The victim must succeed on a Might defense roll to pull free. A victim who dies from this damage is consumed by the blob, and their body becomes part of the creature.

If a blob has absorbed living flesh within the last hour, it regenerates 3 points of health per round while its health is above 0.

Interaction: A blob’s favored method of communication is to absorb whoever tries to interact with it. If a replicant is handy, the blob might talk through it if the blob can touch the replicant and use it like a puppet.

Use: The old man the PCs accidentally hit with their vehicle has a weird, mucus-like growth on one hand (in addition to the damage he sustained in the accident). He probably should be taken to the hospital to have his injuries and the quivering growth looked at.

Loot: A blob might have several cyphers swirling about in its mass that it uses to equip replicants.

GM intrusion: The character pulls free of a blob they were caught under, but a piece of quivering protoplasm remains stuck to their flesh. They must do serious damage to themselves (enough to incapacitate) within the hour, scraping off the protoplasm before it absorbs them and becomes a new mini-blob.

Cryptic Moth 5 (15)

Normal moths are enigmatic, gauzy haunts of twilight. The feathery touch of their wings on your face can startle, even frighten. This is to be expected, since moths are the children of cryptic moths, malign and intelligent entities of another realm. Sometimes referred to as mothmen, other times as shadow faeries, cryptic moths are certainly alien. Each possesses a unique wing pattern and coloration, and, to some extent, body shape. These patterns

and colors may signify where in the hierarchy a particular cryptic moth stands among its siblings of the night, but for those who do not speak the language of moths, the complexity of their social structure is overwhelming.

Motive: Capture humans, possibly for food, possibly for breeding purposes

Environment: Almost anywhere, usually at night

Health: 23

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short; long when flying

Modifications: All knowledge tasks as level 6; stealth tasks as level 7 while invisible 

Combat: Cryptic moths usually enter combat only when they wish, because until they attack

and become visible, they can remain unseen and invisible to most eyes. The touch of a cryptic moth’s wing draws life and energy from targets, inflicting 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).

Cryptic moths regain 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0, unless

they’ve been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon, or by electrical attacks. 

Once every hour or so, a cryptic moth can summon a swarm of normal moths to aid

them in combat or, more often, serve as a fashion accessory or component in a piece of living art.

Moth swarm: level 2

If a cryptic moth is prepared, it may carry cyphers useful in combat, and perhaps even an artifact.

Interaction: Although very few cryptic moths speak human languages, peaceful interaction

with these creatures is not impossible. It’s just extremely difficult, as they see most

humans as a source of food or bodies to lay their eggs in.

Use: A character is followed by a cryptic moth intent on capturing and enslaving them. 

Loot: A cryptic moth usually has a few cyphers, and possibly a delicate artifact.

GM intrusion: The cryptic moth grabs the character and flies up and away, taking the victim with them.

Elder Thing 8 (24)

Elder things are mostly extinct, but a few remain trapped in the Antarctic ice or rule over crumbling cities in deep trenches at the bottom of the ocean.

Beholding an elder thing bends the mind to the point of breaking. An elder thing has a great barrel-like body standing some 8 feet (2 m) tall. Knobby protrusions in the crown and base each unfold five appendages that recall the arms of a starfish. When agitated, an elder thing unfolds a pair of wings that help it flutter a limited distance.

Meddling by elder things created multicellular life that spread across Earth billions of years ago and ultimately brought about humanity. As the younger species grew in numbers and influence, the elder things went into decline, a process hastened by wars against strange beings from other worlds and uprisings by the servitor race they created, the shoggoths.

Motive: Reclaim absolute sovereignty

Environment: In arctic regions or deep underwater

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Immediate; long when flying

Modifications: All tasks related to knowledge of magic or science as level 10; Speed defense

as level 6 due to form

Combat: An elder thing can attack with five tentacles divided any way it chooses among up

to three targets within immediate range. A target hit by a tentacle must also succeed on a Speed defense roll or become grabbed until it escapes. Each round, the elder thing automatically inflicts 6 points of damage on each grabbed target until the victim succeeds on a Might defense roll to escape. 

An elder thing can reach into the mind of a target within short distance. If the target fails an Intellect defense roll, the elder thing reads their thoughts while the target remains within long

distance. During this time, the elder thing knows everything the target knows, hindering the target’s attack and defense rolls against the elder thing. The elder thing can use an action to rend the target’s thoughts, which inflicts 6 points of Intellect damage on a failed Intellect defense roll. An elder thing can passively read the thoughts of up to two creatures at one time.

An elder thing also might carry a few cyphers and an artifact it can use in combat.

Interaction: An elder thing communicates through whistles and pops created by moving air through tiny orifices arranged around its body. Elder things see humans as a lesser form of life and may demand worship, sacrifices, or something else from people it encounters.

Use: Fishermen return to a coastal village with a large block of ice in tow. In the ice is something dark and large—an elder thing frozen alive. If the thing thaws out, it will likely take over the community and enslave the people living there.

Loot: An elder thing usually has one artifact and two or three cyphers.

GM intrusion: A character who sees an elder thing for the first time goes temporarily crazy on a failed Intellect defense roll. They might stand in place and gibber, run away, or laugh hysterically for a few rounds. If the character takes damage, they shake off the temporary madness. 

Fundamental Angel 7 (21)

Fundamental angels are mysterious holy beings that maintain and guard fundamental concepts of the universe, such as time, gravity, and energy. They have powers and agendas deriving from higher states of reality. They are strange, terrifying, and inconstant in form, unlike the relatively benign and comprehensible winged humanoids from religion and myth.

In the rare times when mortals interfere with these concepts, fundamental angels manifest in the world to set things right. They have intervened to destroy cataclysmic atomic weapons, power sources that skirt the rules of matter and energy, and life forms that betray the principles of creation.

For the purpose of vampire aversions, the angel’s direct and area attacks count as religious power or sunlight, whichever is worse for the vampire.

Motive: Preserving the natural order

Environment: Anywhere, usually in response to mortal activity

Health: 35

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 2 (+3 against energy)

Movement: Short; short when flying

Modifications: All knowledge as level 9; attacks against mad science and supernatural targets as level 8

Combat: A fundamental angel attacks other creatures by creating a long-range blast of

bright divine energy that inflicts 8 points of damage. In addition, it automatically inflicts 4 points of damage each round against all creatures within short range, although it can shield itself with wings or other protrusions to negate this effect against individuals.

Any creature within long range that sees it and fails an Intellect defense roll becomes frightened unless the angel tells it (specifically or in general) not to be afraid.

As an action, it can teleport up to a hundred miles away or transport itself fully to its native dimension where it exists as pure thought and spirit.

Interaction: A fundamental angel operates on a mental and metaphysical level far above humans and doesn’t bother to explain itself to anyone other than its targets. It goes out of its way to not harm innocent creatures. It can communicate with any creature that uses language.

Use: “FEAR NOT!” says the radiant being that appears out of nowhere. It ignores bystanders and uses a beam of energy to destroy a scientist and his experimental reactor.

Loot: Fundamental angels sometimes create or refresh subtle cyphers by their mere presence.

GM intrusions:

A fundamental angel’s successful attack also blinds its opponent, lasting until they make an Intellect defense roll (try once each round).

A fundamental angel makes a second attack this round against a target that is adjacent to its primary target.

Hivemind Child 2 (6)

A hivemind family is a scouting expedition of part-alien creatures sent to study and infiltrate human society, either out of scientific curiosity or as a long-term plan for world domination or human extinction. Some entities might intercept human astronauts, reprogramming their DNA or attaching a parasite to their mind or soul. Others might send a machine to

an isolated community, remotely impregnating some of the inhabitants to gestate and give birth at the same time. The end result is a group of hivemind children who have a psychic link, unusual powers, and loyalty to their inhuman creators.

Hivemind children often have a very similar appearance even if they have different parents—they might all have pale blond hair, unusually wide-set eyes, six fingers on one hand, or an odd posture. They eerily match each other’s expressions and movements. They think and speak as children years older than they appear. Their emotional responses are muted to an almost sociopathic extent.

Depending on their origin, the weird children may be mentored or protected by an altered adult, or by human parents in denial about the monsters they care for.

Motive: Conquest, exploration, infiltration

Environment: Human settlements

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Mental attacks and Intellect defense as level 3; defend against attacks from

living creatures as level 3 due to mind reading; perception and scientific knowledge as

level 4

Combat: Individually, hivemind children are physically no stronger or more durable than

a typical human. Their true strength is in their ability to read and control minds. Their telepathic link means that if one of them knows something, all of them within long range automatically know it.

Hivemind children can automatically read the surface thoughts of anyone they can

see within short range, even if the target is unwilling. As an action, they can force

an intelligent living creature within short range to take a physical action, including something that would cause the target harm, such as forcing a target to stick their hand into boiling water, steer a moving car off a cliff, or shoot themselves with a pistol (if used as an attack, this inflicts damage equal to the hivemind child’s level or the controlled creature’s level, whichever is greater).

Two hivemind children within short range of each other automatically augment each other’s mental powers, allowing them to read or control minds of two targets at once as a level 4 creature. Four within short range of each other can read or control minds of four targets at once as a level 5 creature, and eight or more can work together to read or control minds of eight people as a level 6 creature.

Interaction: Hivemind children want to protect themselves and observe humans and will try to do so until they appear as old as adults. Their long-term goals are unclear but probably don’t have humanity’s best interests in mind.

Use: Children born after a scientific expedition are strange and different. Multiple small villages all over the world experience births of children with weird abilities.

Loot: Hivemind children may have no useful items or one weird science device they’ve built with their inhuman knowledge.

GM intrusions: 

A group of hivemind children briefly manifest a teleportation or telekinesis ability

at the same level as their mind control.

The injury or death of one hivemind child angers the rest, increasing their level and damage by +2 for one round.

Ighthsian 5 (15)

Ichthysians are thought to be aquatic evolutionary offshoots of hominids or the result of experiments trying to fuse human and amphibian or fish DNA. They are physically similar to humans standing fully upright, with webbed hands, claws, froglike or fishlike features, gills, and strong muscles from a lifetime of swimming. They live in the water but are comfortable with extended forays onto land. Their intelligence is between that of a smart animal and a human; they can use simple tools such as rocks and sticks, and may build dams to modify waterways in their territory.

Some ichthysians are reputed to have the ability to heal others, and local villages may worship these beings as gods.

Motive: Hunger for flesh, curiosity, solitude 

Environment: Anywhere near bodies of fresh water Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short on land; long in the water

Modifications: Strength-based tasks and swimming as level 6; defense against poison as level 3

Combat: Ichthysians attack with their

powerful claws. They are less mobile on land and prefer to attack from the water. If overmatched, they would rather flee to deep, dark water than fight to the death.

An ichthysian regenerates 2 points of health each round as long as it starts the round with at least 0 health. This regeneration greatly extends their lifespan, and it is common for them to live to be more than two hundred years old.

Ichthysians are prone to mutation, especially in response to pollutants and other chemicals. These mutations might be physical deformities, but could be as strange as transparent flesh, poisonous skin, extra eyes with enhanced senses, or extra limbs.

Interaction: Ichthysians are not aggressive but will retaliate with full force against anything that attacks them, and one can remember specific enemy humans from its past.

Use: A cryptid fish-person has been spotted in the vicinity of a deforested area adjacent to a mighty river. Villagers tell stories of an ancient water god that heals sickness and grants wishes.

Loot: An ichthysian’s lair might have a strange relic or device that works like a cypher or artifact.

GM Intrusions:

A slain ichthysian suddenly regenerates 5 health and immediately attacks or tries to flee.

The ichthysian suddenly mutates in response to an attack, thereafter gaining +2 Armor or +2 levels in defense against that type of attack.

Mummy 6 (18)

Mummies are intelligent undead, usually royalty or members of the priesthood, risen from their burial places to destroy those who disturbed their rest. Many seek to undo wrongs against them from ages past or re-establish themselves in their former high stations. 

Motive: Vengeance, love, power

Environment: Regions where mummification was common Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Climb, stealth, ancient history, and ancient religion as level 8 

Combat: Mummies are strong, capable of lifting an adult human with one hand and throwing the person across a room. They attack with weapons that were buried with them or use their fists. A mummy usually has one or more of the following abilities: 

Curse: Anyone who disturbs a mummy’s tomb must make an Intellect defense roll or become cursed, which hinders their

actions by two steps (forever, or until cured). 

Disease: The mummy’s attacks carry a rotting disease. The target must make a level 5 Might defense roll every twelve hours or take 5 points of ambient damage.

Lifelike appearance: A mummy can repair its body to assume a fully human appearance. This usually requires time and the flesh of several people, often those who awakened it.

Magic: Once per hour, the mummy can cast a spell from the Minor Wish character ability.

Minion: Animate up to four mummified bodies as mindless lesser mummies or skeletons (depending on how well the bodies are preserved), lasting for one day. 

Lesser mummy: level 3, climb and stealth as level 4; health 12; Armor 1

Swarm: Call a swarm of bugs (usually scarab beetles or scorpions) to attack a foe or obscure vision.

Swarm of bugs: level 3

Interaction: Mummies want to destroy anyone who disturbs their burial places. Ambitious mummies might choose living beings to be their spies and servants, bribing them with funereal treasures or threatening them into submission.

Use: Villagers whisper that a tomb has been opened and a mummy’s curse will strike down anyone who gets in the creature’s way.

Loot: Mummies usually have treasures equivalent to three or four expensive items and perhaps a handful of magical manifest cyphers or even a magical artifact.

GM Intrusions:

A dying mummy speaks a curse upon those who killed it, hindering all their actions by two steps (forever, or until cured).

What was overlooked as a fake or a prop turns out to be an actual mummy and attacks a character.

Nightguant 3 (9)

A nightgaunt’s hands and feet have no opposable digits. All its fingers and toes can grasp with firm but unpleasant boneless strength. Hungry nightgaunts swoop out of the night, grab prey, and fly off into darkness. The creatures sometimes “work” for other agencies, though often enough, their goals are obscure.

Motive: Unknowable

Environment: Anywhere dark, usually in groups of four to seven

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Immediate; long when flying (short when flying with a victim) Modifications: Perception and Speed defense as level 4; stealth

as level 7

Combat: A nightgaunt can attack with its barbed tail. To catch a foe, a nightgaunt dives through the air from just outside of short range. When it does, it moves 100 feet (30 m) in a round and attempts to grab a victim near the midpoint of its movement. A target who

fails a Speed defense roll (and who isn’t more than twice the size of the nightgaunt) is jerked into the creature’s boneless clutches and carried upward, finding themselves dangling from a height of 50 feet (15 m).

The nightgaunt automatically tickles grabbed victims with its barbed tail. This subtle form of torture hinders all the victim’s actions by two steps.

Interaction: Nightgaunts never speak, and they ignore anyone who attempts to interact with

them, whether the communication takes the form of commanding, beseeching, or frantically pleading. Such is the way of nightgaunts.

Use: Someone who bears one or more of the PCs a grudge discovers a tome of spells and summons a flight of nightgaunts, which set off in search of their prey.

Loot: One in three nightgaunts has a valuable souvenir from a past victim, which might be an expensive watch, a ring, an amulet, or sometimes a cypher.

GM intrusion: The character is startled by the nightgaunt and suffers the risk of temporary dementia. On a failed Intellect defense roll, the character shrieks and faints (or, at the GM’s option, babbles, drools, laughs, and so on). The character can attempt a new Intellect defense roll each round to return to normal.

Reanimated 6 (18)

A reanimated is a humanoid creature patched together from corpses (or crafted directly from muscle, nerves, and sinew), then returned to life through a hard-to-duplicate series of electromagnetic induction events. Though made of flesh, a reanimated’s return to consciousness and mobility is marked by a substantial increase in hardiness, resistance to injury, and longevity. On the other hand, the process usually obliterates whatever mind was once encoded in the donor’s brain, giving rise to a creature of monstrous rage and childlike credulity. Sometimes the reanimated is bound to its creator in service, but such ties are fragile and could be snapped by an ill-timed fit of fury.

Motive: Defense, unpredictable

Environment: Anywhere in service to a mad scientist, or driven to the edges of civilization Health: 70

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Movement: Short; long when jumping

Modifications: Speed defense as level 4; interaction as level 2; feats of strength and toughness as level 8

Combat: A reanimated attacks foes with its hands. Any time a foe inflicts 7 or more points of damage on the reanimated with a single melee attack, the creature immediately lashes out in reactive rage and makes an additional attack in the same round on the foe who injured it.

If the reanimated begins combat within long range of foes but outside of short range, it can bridge the distance with an amazing leap that concludes with an attack as a single action. The attack inflicts 4 points of damage on all targets within immediate range of the spot where the reanimated lands.

Some reanimated are psychologically vulnerable to fire, and they fear it. When these reanimated attack or defend against a foe wielding fire, their attacks and defenses are hindered by two steps.

If struck by electricity, a reanimated regains a number of points of health equal to the damage the electricity would normally inflict.

Interaction: Fear and food motivate a reanimated, though sometimes beautiful music or innocence can stay its fists.

Use: Depending on where a reanimated falls along its moral and psychological development, it could be a primary foe for the PCs, a secondary guardian to deal with, or a forlorn beast in need of aid.

GM Intrusion:

The character’s attack bounces harmlessly off the stitched, hardened flesh of the reanimated. 

Shoggoth 7 (21)

Shoggoths vary in size, but the smallest are usually at least 10 feet (3 m) across. They are the product of incredibly advanced bioengineering by some strange species in the distant past. They are angry, vicious predators feared by any who have ever heard of these rare creatures (or who have encountered them and somehow survived to tell the tale). They were created by the elder things but overthrew their masters and now roam the vast, ancient cities they have claimed for themselves.

Rumors abound of a few very rare, particularly intelligent shoggoths that intentionally reduce their own mass and learn to take on the forms of humans so they can integrate themselves into society (and prey upon humans at their leisure).

Motive: Hungers for flesh 

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 35

Damage Inflicted: 10 points

Armor: 10 against fire, cold, and electricity 

Movement: Long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to size 

Combat: Shoggoths sprout tendrils and mouths and spread their wide, amorphous forms, allowing them to attack all foes within immediate range. Those struck by a shoggoth’s attack are grabbed and engulfed by the thing’s gelatinous body and suffer damage each

round until they manage to pull themselves free (engulfed creatures can take no other physical actions while they are caught). Each round of entrapment, one object in the victim’s possession is destroyed by the foul juices of the amorphous horror.

Shoggoths regenerate 5 points of health each round. They have protection against fire, cold, and electricity.

Interaction: A shoggoth can’t be reasoned with. 

Use: The PCs find an ancient structure of metal and stone. Wandering through it, they note

that every surface is clear of dirt and debris. Soon they discover why—a shoggoth squirms through the halls, absorbing everything it comes upon (and it fills the passages it moves down, floor to ceiling, wall to wall).

Loot: A shoggoth’s interior might contain a cypher.

GM intrusion: The character is engulfed in the shoggoth, their gear scattered throughout the thing’s undulating form, and their body turned upside down so that escape attempts are hindered.

Yithian 6 (18)

The yithians (also known as the Great Race of Yith) were immense wrinkly cones 10 feet (3 m) high, with a head, four limbs, and other organs spreading from the top of their body. They communicated by making noises with their hands and claws, and they moved by gliding their lower surface across a layer of slime, like a slug. Their civilization was destroyed a billion years before the present day, but they transported their minds into new bodies far in the future and may still be encountered observing the past (our present) by telepathically inhabiting human bodies.

Motive: Knowledge Environment: Anywhere Health: 22

Damage Inflicted: 6 points Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: All knowledge as level 8; Intellect defense as level 7; Speed defense as level 5

due to size and speed

Combat: Although large and hardy, members of the Great Race are ill-suited to physical

combat. If they must engage in melee, they use pincer-like claws. They almost always wield artifacts and cyphers, however, which makes them dangerous opponents. Assume that a yithian has one or more of the following abilities arising from advanced technology devices:

• Force field that grants them +3 Armor

• Mental field that gives them +4 Armor against any mental attack

• Ray emitter that inflicts 7 points of damage up to long range

> • Cloaking field that renders them invisible for up to ten minutes

• Stun weapon with short range that makes the target fall unconscious for ten minutes

Yithians have the ability to transfer their consciousness backward or forward through time, swapping minds with a creature native to the era they wish to observe. A yithian inhabiting the body of another creature is in complete control of that body. A creature trapped in the body of a yithian must attempt Intellect-based tasks each time it wishes to exert control.

For the most part, it is trapped in the yithian’s body and is merely along for the ride.

It’s worth noting that the bodies the yithians use are not their original bodies, but instead the bodies of supremely ancient creatures that they inhabit. The Great Race hails originally from some extraterrestrial world.

Interaction: Yithians are not malicious, but they are quite focused and relatively uncaring about other races, such as humans.

Use: A yithian projects its mind across the aeons, swapping consciousnesses with the character. While controlling the character’s body, the yithian is there mainly to learn and observe, and rarely takes any violent actions.

Loot: A yithian encountered in the flesh will have 1d6 manifest cyphers and very likely a technological artifact.

GM intrusion: 

The yithian produces a cypher that has a function that is perfect for its current situation: a teleporter to get away, a protective field against precisely the kind of attack being used against it, or a weapon that exploits a weakness of the character’s.

## FAIRYTALE CREATURES

The following creatures and characters are provided to help populate your fairy tale game. 

Generally, the listings in this book work much the same way as they do for all Cypher System creature listings—the standard template includes the level, description, motive, environment, and so on.

The most important element of each creature is its level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to attack, defend against, or otherwise interact with a creature or NPC. In each entry, the difficulty number for the creature is listed in parentheses after its level.

A creature’s target number is usually also its health, which is the amount of damage it can sustain before it is dead or incapacitated. For easy reference, most entries list a creature’s health, and they always do so if it’s different from the normal amount for a creature of its level.

For more detailed information on how to use level, health, combat, and other elements, see the Understanding the Listings section in the Cypher System Rulebook.

Due to the dual and complex nature of many creatures in fairy tales, along with the large number of archetypes, there are several additional elements that you’ll want to take particular note of when using the creature listings.

A creature’s health is always equal to its target number unless otherwise stated.

## MAGICAL ANIMALS

Bear: level 5; health 20; Armor 1; two magical abilities

Cat: level 2; two magical abilities

Fish: level 2; one magical ability

Fox/Rabbit/Monkey: level 3, cunning and trickery as level 5; two magical abilities

Horse/Donkey: level 4; two magical abilities

Mouse/Rat: level 2; one magical ability

Raven/Owl: level 3, intelligence and cunning as level 4; one magical ability

Snake/Serpent: level 3; bite inflicts 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor); one magical ability

Songbird: level 1; offer sage advice to those they choose; one magical ability

Stag/Hart: level 4; Armor 1; horns inflict 3 points of damage; two magical abilities

Suggested Magical Abilities for Animals

Bless (use magic to give a character or object something beneficial, such as giving a weapon +1 damage for one round, or giving another character +1 Armor for one round)

Boon (provide the character with a small beneficial object, such as a goose that lays a golden egg, a fish that finds a lost ring, and so on)

Conjure (create a small useful item, such as a flask of water, a loaf of bread, or a candle)

Curse (curse another creature to inflict damage, stun, daze, or otherwise affect them negatively for one or more rounds)

Glamour (make themselves or someone else look different for a short period of time, or cast an illusion over a small area or for a short duration)

Healing (heal themselves, another character, or a natural element of the world for 1–3 Pool points or health)

Information (give directions to a town, the name of the man who lives in the nearby cottage, or the rumors about the area)

Invisibility (turn themselves, another character, an object, or a place invisible for a short period of time)

Sage Advice (see the future, offer suggestions on a difficult task, or guide a character’s actions)

Shapeshifting (become a different type of animal or object, or cause someone else to become an animal or object for a short period of time)

Wish Granting (grant a small wish, such as the ability to float for a short time in order to cross a river)

Talking Objects

If you have a talking object in your game, it has a level (just like creatures and regular objects), and every interaction with it is based on that level. Its level can be based on

its physical and mental complexity as well as its purpose. So something like a singing teapot might be level 2 with 2 Armor, and it can hurl its lid at a foe to inflict 2 points of damage. A complicated talking lock who guards a precious treasure might be level 5 or 6 and can cast a spell (inflicting 3 points of damage) on anyone who tries to pick it.

Some abilities in the game work only on objects, or only on creatures, or only on living things. A talking object might or might not be living, depending on its nature.

## OF BITE AND CLAW (CREATURES)

The creatures in this section all appear to be animal in their nature, from black dogs and big bad wolves to horses and snarks.

Bagheera: This cunning, bold, and brilliant black panther can be someone’s worst enemy or their most loyal friend, protector, and mentor.

Level 7; stalking, hunting, sneaking,

and chasing prey as level 8; persuasion and positive social interactions as level 8; inflicts 6 points of damage with teeth and claws; can pounce on a victim from a long distance away to inflict 7 points of damage and knock the victim prone.

Beast (with a capital B): Sometimes a human cursed, sometimes an animal blessed, often just a creature from the beginning, Beasts are bestial humanoids with large claws and jaws. Most Beasts have a single thing that they love deeply and will do anything to protect: a garden, a human, their home, a book from their childhood.

Level 6, intimidation and protection as level 7; Armor 2; inflicts 4 points of damage with an item related to their beloved (gardening shears, for example).

Cheshire Cat: Interacting with this riddling, punning, disappearing striped cat is enough to make anyone feel discombobulated. Can make a great ally if you’re seeking answers, have lost your way, or need advice.

Level 6, punning and wordplay as level 7, Speed defense as level 8 due to intangibility; will disappear rather than fight.

Puss in Boots: Smart and smart-alecky, Puss in Boots always has a plan in motion, and at least two others that are about to begin.

Level 5; planning, scheming, persuasion, and deception as

level 7; Armor 2; inflicts 4 points of damage with elaborate swordplay.

Black Dog 6 (18)

Black dogs go by many names: hellhounds, bearers of death, black hounds of destiny, and devil dogs, just to name a few. Typically they are spectral or demonic entities that show up at night. They are often sinister, malevolent, or purposefully harmful (such as the Barghest and Black Shuck). Occasionally, black dogs are helpful and benevolent, guarding people from danger, helping them find the correct path, or signifying the death of someone nearby.

Black dogs are usually large, shaggy, and as black as night, with long ears and tails. However, despite their name, they can be any color. The real distinction is that they are definitely not regular, living dogs. Some have eyes like fire, some howl with a ghostly, ethereal song, and still others have telltale witches’ marks upon their chest or back.

Black dogs can see ghosts, witches, and other magical entities not typically visible to other creatures. They are sometimes a portent of death, but not always. Many carry with them an inherent sense of sadness and despair, which they can pass on to those around them. 

Black dogs sometimes serve as familiars for witches and sorcerers.

Motive: Bring harm and pain; help and guard

Environment: Crossroads, places of execution, and ancient paths Health: 20

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Long; very long when running

Modifications: Sneaking, hiding, and attacking from surprise or advantage as level 7 Combat: Malevolent black dogs will attack from a position of surprise or advantage,

inflicting 8 points of damage with their spectral teeth and claws. Some black dogs cause such a deep feeling of despair and sadness, just by being nearby, that they inflict 2 points of Intellect damage each round on everyone who can see them or otherwise sense their presence.

Interaction: Running, at least from the malevolent ones, is typically the best course

of action. Dealing with helpful black dogs is often an interesting and unexpected

experience, as they don’t talk and don’t explain who they choose to help or why. 

Use: The characters are fighting an extremely tough foe when a black dog steps in to

help them out (or to help their foe). The characters are lost in the woods, and a large,

menacing black dog steps out of the forest and leads them back to safety.

Loot: Black dogs rarely have anything valuable on them. However, killing a black dog causes

it to haunt whoever dealt it the fatal blow. That person feels such deep anxiety and despair that all their actions are hindered for at least one day, and often longer.

GM intrusions: The black dog howls, creating such a mournful sound that everyone in very long distance who can hear it takes 4 points of Intellect damage. A character who sees the black dog is deeply affected by sadness and moves one step down the damage track.

Cat Sidhe 4 (12)

Cat sidhes, sometimes called phantom cats, are dog-sized felines that were once witches and now have shifted permanently into cat form. They’re all black except for a single white symbol on their chest, which is their name.

When cat sidhes form (because a witch has turned themselves into a cat for the ninth time), they gain nine tails. Each time a cat sidhe would be killed, they can choose to lose one of their tails instead. Once a cat sidhe has no more tails remaining, their death is final. 

While cat sidhes inflict damage with their soul-stealing attacks, the roleplaying element of a character losing part of their soul is possibly more important than the game effect. Consider removing something from the character that will affect them in interesting and unusual ways.

Motive: Steal souls, gain power

Environment: Highlands, mountains, and forests

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to quickness and agility

Combat: Cat sidhes can attack with their claws for 6 points of damage, but they much

prefer to engage from a long distance, using their unique ability to cast curses that steal part or all of a victim’s soul. They may attack a foe using the following types of soul-stealing curses. Characters who succeed on an Intellect defense roll resist the effect, but take 1 point of Intellect damage due to the effort. If someone can read the symbol on the cat’s chest and pronounce it, they gain +1 Armor against the cat’s attacks.

Falter. Removes a favored part of the creature’s personality, such as their sense of humor, courage, or kindness. The creature doesn’t forget that they had that part of their personality; they just can’t remember how to access it again. All social interactions are hindered.

Fester. Replaces a piece of the character’s soul with an idea, false memory, or thought that, once placed, grows into something insidious and dangerous inside them. The character takes no damage at the time, but each time they make a recovery roll, they take 2 points of Intellect damage.

Forget. Removes something from the creature’s memory, such as all nouns (including their own name), a loved one’s face, their current purpose, an ability, or a skill. This inflicts 3 points of Intellect damage and causes the character to forget the specific thing.

Interaction: Having once been witches, cat sidhes are smart, cunning, and dangerous. Most have no interest in conversations or bargains, unless they are injured in some way. They

can, however, sometimes be distracted from their purpose of stealing souls by riddles, music, and children’s games.

Use: A cat sidhe stalks a forest where the characters are passing through on their way elsewhere. Someone sends the characters to capture a “lost” cat, which turns out to be a cat sidhe.

Loot: When a cat sidhe dies, it disappears, leaving behind only the once-white symbol on its chest in the form of a medallion.

GM intrusion: The cat sidhe yowls, causing a second cat sidhe to appear from hiding

Satyr 5 (15)

These muscular humanoids sport long curved horns and furry, hooved legs. They are self-centered, greedy, and sybaritic creatures, dedicated to food, drink, and other pleasures. They rob and steal from others as it pleases them, often relying on tricks and lies, or on alluring music they play on pipes.

Motive: Play tricks, gather treasure, fulfill desires

Environment: In woodlands where other faerie or mythological creatures are found

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tasks related to persuasion and deception as level 7; resists mental attacks as level 7

Combat: Satyrs usually carry spears that they can use in melee and against foes within short range.

Satyrs can also create magical effects by playing their pipes as an action, which can either bolster allies or harm enemies. 

Dance of the Leaping Stag: Foes within short range who fail an Intellect defense task lose their next turn dancing and leaping. Attacks made against affected targets are eased by one step.

Feral Overture: An ally within short range is infused with magic. One attack it makes on its next turn is eased by one step, and if it hits, it inflicts +3 damage.

Tune of the Clouded Mind: A foe within short range who fails an Intellect defense task spends its next turn attacking one of its allies.

Interaction: A satyr is always willing to start negotiations, but is prone to lying and exaggeration. Offering excessive libation, food, and other treasures is the only way to ensure a satyr remains honest, if only for a short period.

Use: Strange piping music in the forest lures away young men and women from a nearby community. The elders say a charismatic cult leader has set up in the woods, and clouds the minds of all who come near.

Loot: A satyr is likely to carry

GM intrusion: If the character fails an Intellect defense task, they think of the satyr as a good friend for up to one minute or until they can escape the mental effect.

Snark 7 (21)

The snark is unimaginable. It is a Boojum, you see. An agony in eight fits. Part snail and shark and bark and snake and snarl. It has feathers that bite, claws that catch, and jaws that snatch. It softly and suddenly vanishes away, never to be met with again. It smells of the will-o-wisp, sleeps late in the day, and breathes fire when it finds something funny (which is nearly never).

Motive: Unfathomable

Environment: Upon islands filled with chasms and crags, near bathing machines, and around those whose coats are too tight in the waist Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short when moving perpendicular; long when moving sideways 

Modifications: Invisibility, shapeshifting, confusion, and mimsy as level 8

Combat: Inflicts 5 points of damage with biting feathers, catching claws, and snatching jaws. Also blows out a stream of fire that can light a match or inflict 3 points of damage to everyone in close range.

Interaction: Not recommended.

Use: The characters are given the impossible task of hunting a snark. Whether or not they actually find one, they have grand adventures along the way.

Loot: The frabjous joy of catching the impossible, improbable, unimaginable snark.

GM intrusion: Everything about the snark is a GM intrusion.

Wolf, Big Bad 8 (24)

The Big Bad Wolf (just call him the Wolf, for he is truly the only one worthy of that title) is a beast of near immortality, kept alive by the legends that swirl around him, the constant stream of terrorizing tales. Once the stalker of the woods, now he stalks the streets and towns, no longer staying to the shadows, no longer merely hunting girls and grandmothers. As his reputation has grown, so has his appetite. He hungers. He swallows worlds. He will not be contained. 

Motive: Hunger

Environment: Woods, cities, behind you

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 8 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Long

Modifications: Hunting, seeking, and sneaking as level 9

Combat: The Wolf ’s bite does 8 points of damage. Additionally, he has a variety of abilities that he may use.

What Big Ears You Have: Can track and hear his prey up to a mile away. Tracking ignores all cloaking abilities, including magical ones.

What Big Eyes You Have: Mesmerizes his victims for two rounds, convincing them that he is a friend and that they should do what he suggests.

What Big Teeth You Have: Swallows his victim whole, holding them in his belly. It’s a level 8 Speed or Might defense task to avoid being eaten whole. Captured characters can attempt to cut themselves free, which requires three successful attacks.

Huff and Puff: Exhale creates a wind so strong it can knock over foes, trees, and even houses. Inflicts 6 points of damage to everything within long distance, and knocks most things prone. Once the Wolf uses this ability, he can’t use it again for three rounds.

Interaction: Despite his constant hunger and his gnawing need to swallow the world, the Wolf makes an interesting ally (provided that he’s well fed at the time) for he is smart and cunning, and has myriad tricks for moving through the world.

Use: The Big Bad Wolf is a great character to introduce into a modern fairy tale game. Imagine his new iteration as an urban legend, spreading through the internet.

GM intrusions: The Wolf makes a great leap, knocking down foes. The Wolf already has someone swallowed in his belly, and that person calls for help from out of the Wolf’s mouth.

## CRAFTED (CREATURES)

Crafted creatures are those made by human, fey, or other hands. In fairy tales these might include characters like Pinocchio,

the Iron Giant, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man.

Gingerbread Creatures

Gingerbread creatures can take any shape and form, but are most often humans, dogs, or dragons. Typically crafted and brought to life by witches and enchanters, gingerbread creatures tend to remain loyal to their creators, even if they are treated poorly.

Level 2, Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness; when touched or eaten, some gingerbread creatures release a sweet, slow poison that inflicts 1 point of damage each round for 1d6 rounds.

Geppetto’s Children

Made of wood and wishes, Geppetto’s children are everywhere in the world. They go through a number of life stages, starting as wooden puppets and eventually becoming real humans. No matter what stage they’re in, they’re nonstop sources of destruction and chaos.

Level 4; Armor 1; have a passion for creating, collecting, and using cyphers, particularly detonation cyphers

Virgilius’s Copper Dogs

Once the loyal companions of Virgilius the Sorcerer, this pack of dogs now runs feral. Despite being created through the power of magic, they despise anything that stinks of magic and attempt to bring it down.

Level 5; Armor 2

Tin Woodman 7 (21)

Once an ordinary woodman of flesh and blood named Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman’s story is a sad one. His beloved axe was enchanted by a wicked witch in order to keep him from his other true love (it’s a long story, but suffice it to say that witches who are wicked do wicked things). His beloved axe turned on Nick Chopper, taking off one limb after another. A tinsmith kindly replaced Nick’s missing body parts (except his heart) with tin prosthetics, but eventually nothing was left of the original human and he became the Tin Woodman.

Note that the Tin Woodman will never tell you this story himself, for he has no heart and seeks only revenge: revenge upon the witch who cursed him, upon the tinsmith who did not replace his heart, upon the rain that rusts him. Someday, he will find all the original parts of himself, no matter who they belong to currently, so that he can return to his original form.

Motive: Revenge, find his original body parts 

Environment: Anywhere

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short; immediate if rusted Modifications: Speed defense as level 5 due to rust

Combat: Inflicts 7 points of damage with his enchanted axe.

Interaction: The Tin Woodman is singularly focused, and cares only about clues that lead to revenge or his original body parts. He does not eat, drink, or sleep, and often comes across as frantic and frenzied.

Use: The PCs are hunting the same foe that the Tin Woodman is, and either they join together, or the Tin Woodman tries to prevent them from reaching the foe before he does.

Loot: Enchanted axe

> Enchanted axe (artifact): level 7; inflicts 7 points of damage; can be activated to move a long distance away from the wielder and attack a foe as an action. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each activation)

GM intrusion: A character’s weapon gets caught in the Tin Woodman’s metal body, pulling the weapon out of their hands. 

Death 10 (infinite)

Death goes by many names, takes many forms, and has only one purpose: to make all equal in the end. Death is often an unwanted visitor—taking the life of someone who is not ready to go—but just as often, they come to those who are ready. To them, Death is a most welcome, the most welcome, guest of all.

While some see Death as evil, they are not inherently so, no more than the cougar hunting the hare for dinner. In fact, they are the great equalizer, raising paupers to kings and kings to common people.

Death is ancient, but not old. Wise, but not all-knowing. Brilliant, but not perfect. Death is also, very often, bored. They have seen everything, heard everything, and done everything that it is possible for an immortal being to do, and some days they feel sure they will never experience anything new or interesting again. But still, they try, taking on new guises, hiding themselves away, even traveling to distant stars and moons before their duties and obligations once again pull them to return.

If Death appears at the foot of a person’s bed, that person can recover if the proper steps are taken. If Death is at the head of the bed, almost nothing can be done to save the victim, beyond an impossible bargain.

Motive: To do their duty and make everyone equal

Environment: Everywhere and anywhere

Health: ∞

Damage Inflicted: Death

Armor: Immune to all harm

Movement: Variable depending on their form, but Death can move instantaneously almost

anywhere that they desire

Modifications: Seeing through trickery, deception, or bargaining as level 8

Combat: Death kills. They kill any number of ways, depending on their mood, what’s at

hand, and how they believe the person should leave their life. Thankfully, death only comes for someone when their time is up.

Still, it’s not considered wise to provoke or challenge Death to physical combat, for there is only one outcome: a single attack from Death kills the victim (except in the rare case where the victim has protection against death, such as with one of Death’s candles).

Interaction: Death cannot be hurt and cannot be killed, but they can be bargained with, bet against, and sometimes tricked. More rarely, they have even been known to lose a bargain or be captured for a short period of time.

Use: Bargaining with Death is a potential way to achieve an impossible task or gain a very rare item, but of course it always comes with a price (usually an earlier death for the bargainer or someone else). Death is always looking for something interesting going on, and may appear just to spend time with the characters if they’re engaged in an intriguing activity.

GM intrusion: Death mistakes a character for someone else.

## OF EARTH AND STONE (CREATURES)

Creatures of the earth are those that seem to belong to the land in some unique and significant way. Perhaps they are made of the land and its offerings—tree beings, rock trolls, and so on—or perhaps they seem attached to the land in important ways, such as the way in which the minotaur is part of its maze or the way that dwarves have a unique connection to mountains.

Because the archetype of earth beings covers a broad range of creatures, there is no general entry for an earth being.

Dwarf: level 4; Armor 2; mining pick inflicts 4 points of damage; beards provide magical abilities such as finding treasure, enabling flight, shapeshifting, and turning invisible. Cutting a dwarf’s beard off or learning their name provides an asset on all interactions with that dwarf.

Feral tree: level 3; Armor 3; no movement; lashing branches attack up to three characters as a single action; on a failed Might defense task, the characters are held in place until they can escape.

Troll: level 6; claws inflict 7 points of damage and grab victim until they can escape; grabbed creature takes 10 points of damage per round; troll regains 3 points of health per round.

Erlking 6 (18)

This vaguely humanoid creature is an animated accumulation of woodland debris—bark, lost teeth, matted weeds, and dirt. It wears a crown of oak leaves and a cloak of mist.

Its eyes are knotholes, and its hands are sharpened twigs. An erlking is a greedy spirit of hunger deemed Unseelie by the faerie nobility of that wild and wicked realm. Erlkings love to hunt and eat children, who are particularly susceptible to the promises and glamours that the creatures spin.

An erlking is a former noble stripped of title, lands, and even form,

and exiled into the night for crimes unimaginable in their cruelty. An erlking’s victims are found in the cold sunlight, pale and bloodless, with their vital organs nibbled out.

Motive: Hungers for flesh and to reclaim stripped titles 

Environment: Almost anywhere wooded at night Health: 27

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 4

Movement: Short; immediate when burrowing

Modifications: Stealth tasks as level 7

Combat: An erlking prefers to attack from hiding, and whisper a child or other creature

within short distance from their bed out into the night if the victim fails an Intellect defense task. An affected creature remains under the erlking’s spell for up to an hour or until attacked or otherwise harmed.

When it attacks physically, an erlking can attack three times on its turn with root tendrils. A target hit by a tendril must also succeed on a Speed defense roll or become grabbed until they escape. The erlking automatically inflicts 6 points of damage on each grabbed creature each round until they succeed on a Might-based task to escape.

Silvered and cold iron weapons ignore an erlking’s Armor. If an erlking’s remains are not burned or otherwise destroyed, it will sprout and grow a new body from its corpse within a day.

Interaction: An erlking may negotiate if creatures have something it wants, or if targets are armed with silvered or cold iron weapons.

Use: An erlking is active only by night; by day, it hides beneath a mound of weedy earth indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain.

GM intrusion: A character surprised by an erlking in the darkness must succeed on an Intellect defense task or lose their next action as they faint, run screaming, or stand paralyzed in terror.

Minotaur, the 7 (21)

The most famous minotaur is the Minotaur, the singular beast from which all lesser minotaur myths descend. The product of a god-cursed union between human and bull,

the Minotaur is monstrous, and only the flesh of people can nourish it. It is usually lost

in a labyrinth created to contain it. But it occasionally gets free to hunt the wider world before the labyrinth pulls it back. Some demigods claim to have slain the Minotaur, but the Minotaur always returns.

Motive: Hungers for flesh

Environment: Usually in mythological labyrinths, but sometimes metaphorical ones Health: 33

Damage Inflicted: 10 points

Armor: 3

Movement: Short

Modifications: Breaking through barriers as level 9

Combat: The Minotaur attacks by goring foes on its horns, inflicting 10 points of damage

on a successful attack. If the Minotaur charges a short distance, it can attack as part of

the same action and inflict an additional 5 points of damage.

The Minotaur is trapped by the labyrinth, but also part of it. Whenever a character attacks

the Minotaur, they must succeed on an Intellect defense task or be claimed by the labyrinth themselves until they can escape with a successful difficulty 7 Intellect task. Those claimed by the labyrinth seem to disappear and find themselves wandering a dark maze. Once a character successfully escapes, they are no longer subject to being claimed by the labyrinth for several days.

If killed, the Minotaur’s body is claimed by the labyrinth. Thirty-three days later, the Minotaur is resuscitated.

Interaction: The Minotaur can speak, but usually chooses not to. It is belligerent and cruel, and always hungry.

Use: The Minotaur has escaped the labyrinth and now wanders the narrow streets of a metropolis, treating the winding alleys and twisting roads as its new maze.

GM intrusion: The Minotaur smashes into the wall, causing a section of the tunnel or hallway to collapse on the character(s), inflicting 10 points of damage and trapping them until they can escape the rubble

Enchanter 5 (15)

Enchanters include magic-users of all genders. They may choose to call themselves wizards, sorcerers, mages, or diviners, depending on their strengths, abilities, and desired reputations.

Enchanters usually take great pride in their appearance, including their outfits, accouterments, and equipment. They often incorporate living or dead elements of dangerous creatures, such as spiders, snakes, crocodiles, and dragons, into the objects that matter to them. Additionally, they may imbue objects with powerful magic.

Enchanters can use long-lasting or even permanent versions of their magical abilities, but doing so usually requires minutes or hours of time.

Most enchanters have one or more apprentices or helpers, typically animals that have been made human temporarily or humans who are in the service of the enchanter until some debt of theirs or their family’s has been paid.

Sorcerer’s Apprentice: level 3

Motive: Control magic, power

Environment: Everywhere, particularly in places where magic is present and powerful Health: 20

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Using and controlling magic as level 7

Combat: Magical weapons and artifacts (such as a whip made of living snakes, a staff with a

biting wolf’s head on top, or a sword that acts of its own accord) do 5 points of damage. Additionally, an enchanter may employ a number of magical abilities, including the

Following:

Animate: Takes any material (such as wood or stone) and turns it into an animate level

4 creature. The creature has a mind and will of its own, and acts just as that type of

creature would act if it were born instead of created.

Blood to Stone: Turns living creatures into stone, or immobilizes them in their current form. Breaking free is a level 6 Might task.

Enchant: Imbues a normal object with a magical power. The object works under the

enchanter’s command, and does as the enchanter asks of it. For example, an enchanter might imbue a foe’s weapon and force it to attack the foe, or they might imbue a door and have it close tight against incoming dangers.

Endless Passage: Creates an endless series of thick spiderwebs, invisible barriers, rings of flame, or other hurdles across an entrance, exit, tunnel, or passage. Every time one of the hurdles is broken, another forms. Characters’ movement is halved while going through the endless passage, and they take 2 points of Intellect damage each round.

Invisible: Turns anything (including themselves, others, and entire areas up to 30 feet by 30 feet \[9 m by 9 m\]) invisible for ten minutes. It’s a level 6 Intellect task to be able to see something that has been made invisible.

Persuasion: Convinces all victims in long range that what they believe is not real or that what is false is real. Sometimes this ability just affects others’ minds, creating a mental dissonance. Other times, the enchanter creates an illusion or other visible, auditory, and tactile element that persuades a character to believe everything they are

experiencing. The effect lasts for ten minutes. Additionally, an enchanter may have one or more of the same abilities as a witch or a faerie.

Interaction: For the characters, an enchanter may be a terrifying foe or a powerful ally. Enchanters are fickle, perhaps due to their close relationship with magic, and may change their loyalties on a whim or an imagined slight.

Use: The characters need to have an object imbued, a person returned to life, or a curse undone, and they turn to the enchanter for help. The characters accidentally insulted

the enchanter in some way, and now the enchanter is hunting them down to get revenge.

Loot: Enchanters often protect their precious items with spells and magical locks (level 8). Behind those wards are 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and an elegant or interesting outfit.

## ENCHANTERS OF THE WORLD

Morgan Le Fay 9 (27)

Morgan le Fay (also known as Morgen, Margain, Morgant, and various other names) is a powerful sorceress from the legends of King Arthur. She has an unpredictable duality to her nature, with the potential for great good and great evil.

Combat: Attacks with a variety of weapons, including a sword and staff. She also can use

any of the following abilities: charm, enchant, glamour, heal, invisible, persuasion,

protect, revive, seduce, and shrivel.

Interaction: Morgan le Fay is fickle and enigmatic, and rarely reveals her purposes. If she

agrees to help the characters in some way, it’s absolutely because she has a higher goal

in mind.

Use: The characters are stopped by a beautiful woman in the woods, who asks them to

help her accomplish a great task. A powerful foe has brought Morgan le Fay into his confidence, and she is helping him against the PCs.

Oz, The Great and Terrible 5 (15)

It is perhaps the greatest feat the Wizard of Oz ever pulled off to make everyone believe that he was not a sorcerer at all, but merely a ventriloquist and balloonist from some faraway land. He is, in fact, far more powerful than that, but prefers that no one were ever to know. For if they did, they would expect things of him, and that makes him anxious. 

Combat: Oz does not fight, but instead sends his army of green-whiskered soldiers forth.

He may also use an artifact or spell to protect himself, hide himself, or flee. He can use

the following abilities: enchant, invisible, persuasion.

Green-whiskered soldiers: level 4; Armor 2; unloaded rifles deal 4 points of damage

Interaction: Curmudgeonly and a bit of a humbug, but rarely with evil intent, Oz is likely to

help those who ask, although he often fumbles things just to make a point.

Use: The characters set off to meet the powerful ruler of a strange land. Or they encounter

someone they believe is just a humble, simple man, but who instead turns out to be

incredibly powerful.

Loot: Oz has at least one artifact, as well as 1d6 cyphers.

Virgilius the Sorcerer 7 (21)

The most renowned of all the poet-sorcerers, Virgilius studies and uses the power of the written word to enhance his magical abilities. He keeps a black book, which is the source of his spells, and creates copper creatures to protect and defend him. He has a love of challenges, such as magician’s battles, and seeks them out.

Combat: Can use the following abilities: animate, blood to stone, enchant, endless passage. Interaction: Virgilius is quick thinking, wily, and full of interesting schemes. Those who

entertain him for longer than a moment might find him a very useful ally. However, he is also driven toward revenge, particularly on those who attempt to publicly humiliate or shame him.

Use: The characters enter into a battle of wits or wills, only to discover they’re competing with Virgilius.

Loot: Carries a black book

> Black book (artifact): level 6; allows the user to cast animate, blood to stone, enchant, or endless passage. Casting a spell from the black book costs 2 Intellect points and is an action. 
>
> Depletion: 1 in 1d6

## FEY (CREATURES)

In fairy tales, the word fey covers a huge category of creatures, from faeries, brownies, and imps to gremlins, boggarts, and goblins. There are so many types of fey beings in

the world that it’s nearly impossible to categorize them as just one thing, or to list them all. They do have a few characteristics in common, however. They are typically sentient, humanoid in form, connected to nature in some way, and magical.

Angiks: Reanimated spirits of babies who died, typically due to hard winters, and who now haunt the living. At night, they turn into giant owls and prey on solitary travelers.

Level 3; talons inflict 4 points of damage

Changelings: Fairy children left in place of stolen human babies (and occasionally adults as well), typically raised among humans.

Level 2; shapeshifting and knowledge of the fey world as level 4

Nymphs: Supernatural beings (often female) associated with protecting a particular location or landform, such as a river, tree, or mountain.

Level 3, stealth and positive social interactions as level 6

Pixies: Benign and mischievous creatures that live near stone circles, tombs, and other burial grounds.

Level 2, stealth and finding lost items as level 6

Faerie 3 (9)

In general, faeries (sometimes called fairies or fair folk) are humanoid in appearance, small in stature, and magical. They are associated with music, mirth, tricks, and taunts. Seeing one is an omen—hopefully, an omen of a silly song or the first appearance of an annoying new road companion (the very faerie sighted) flitting around, asking the questions of a curious four-year-old hyped up on sugar water and ice cream. Some faeries are tricksters, delighting in playing pranks and stealing clothing, equipment, or prized objects. And a few are malicious, luring travelers to their various dooms, making deadly deals, and forcing others into captivity.

Not all faeries have wings, but those that do find many ways to use them to their advantage.

Motive: Unpredictable

Environment: Encountered alone or in a flutter of three to twelve, usually in forests Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Immediate; long when flying

Modifications: Tasks related to performance and deception as level 5; Speed defense as

level 5 due to size and quickness

Combat: A faerie attacks by hurling sparkling magic dust at a target within short range. In

addition, if a faerie is touched or struck by a melee weapon, more magic dust puffs away from the faerie and clouds the attacker, who must succeed on a Speed defense task or suffer the same amount of damage they just dealt to the faerie. Sometimes faeries wield tiny weapons, such as bows, spears, or swords; treat these as light weapons.

A faerie can see in the dark, but it can also emit bright light (often colored) and appear as a glowing humanoid or an illuminated sphere.

Faeries regain 1 point of health per round while their health is above 0 unless they’ve been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon.

In addition to inflicting damage with their fairy dust and their weapons of choice, faeries have a number of curses and abilities at their disposal. These include the following:

> Animal Friend: Most faeries can communicate with animals, and a few can even summon animals within long range for help and protection. Some faeries can also grant others the ability to communicate with animals, but only for a day.
>
> Charm: Some faeries can attempt to use a song or light display to charm others within short range. The target must succeed on an Intellect defense task or fall into a suggestible state for one hour. During this period, the target can be led by the faerie until attacked, damaged, or shaken from their glamour.
>
> Clairvoyance: The faerie grants someone the ability to see the future, the past, faeries, or one of the hidden faerie worlds. This gift lasts for one day, or until the character makes a ten-hour recovery roll.
>
> Heal: The faerie heals themselves, a plant, a creature, or another character for 1d6 + 2 points of damage.
>
> Illusion: Powerful faeries can cast elaborate and convincing illusions that make them and their worlds appear more appealing and beautiful. Illusions can cover up to a mile in area. Seeing through the illusion is a task equal to the faerie’s level and lasts for ten minutes. After that, the viewer reverts to seeing the illusion and quickly forgets that they saw anything else.
>
> Invisibility: Makes the faerie invisible to most eyes. Seeing, hearing, or sensing a faerie when it’s invisible is a task equal to the faerie’s level. A failed attempt to see a faerie causes the viewer to see something that harms their mind, inflicting 1 point of Intellect damage.
>
> Vortex: A defensive tactic where one or more threatened faeries use their wings to create a strong gust of wind, tornado, or vortex. The wind pushes their foes back a long distance and inflicts 2 points of damage.
>
> Faeries have a wide variety of weaknesses, including silver, iron, technology, sugar and salt (they must count each grain), and cream (intoxicates them). But not all faeries have the same weaknesses, and some may not have any.

Interaction: Faeries are mercurial creatures, but except for the malicious ones, they can be negotiated with, especially if offered sweets, wine, cream, or other gifts. That said, faerie attention spans are limited, so even one that means well could end up leaving the PCs in the lurch at just the wrong moment.

Use: The characters come upon an injured faerie, who promises to grant them their deepest wish if they agree to help it. They must decide if they believe the faerie speaks true, or if it’s a trap.

Loot: The tiny pouches that faeries carry are stuffed with forest bric-a-brac, but some of those pouches are ten times larger on the inside and could contain expensive items or cyphers.

GM intrusion: A character accidentally does something to offend a helpful faerie, causing it to turn on them.

Fairy Godmother 6 (18)

Fairy godmothers are nearly always beneficent beings, typically acting as mentors, parents, or protectors, much like human godparents. The difference, of course, is that fairy godmothers have a great deal more magic at their disposal.

Overall, fairy godmothers are kind, gentle, and loving to almost everyone, not just their godchildren. Of course, not all fairy godmothers are good at their roles—some may act out of their own interests and inadvertently (or purposefully) do harm to those they are supposed to protect. This is particularly true if they feel like they have not been given the respect they deserve, or have been offended in some way.

And if you should harm someone they have pledged to protect? Beware, beware, for there is no wrath like that of a fairy godmother’s.

Motive: Protect their protégés, be respected

Environment: Cities, towns, and anywhere someone is in need of assistance

Health: 24

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Armor: 2 (magical)

Movement: Short; long when flying

Combat: Fairy godmothers attack by shooting a stream of sharp-edged glitter up to a long

distance from their magic wands (glitter gets into every nook and cranny, and thus ignores Armor). Fairy godmothers can bestow blessings upon their friends and allies, and curse their enemies.

Fairy godmothers can cast any of the skills and abilities that faeries can cast, as well as a few that are specific to them, including the following:

> A Little Luck: The fairy godmother blesses a character with luck, granting them the opportunity to reroll once in the next day without spending XP.
>
> A Little Misfortune: Despite the name, this is usually a beneficial spell. It is designed to give a nearby character something to overcome so that they might grow stronger in temperament or stature. When this spell is cast, the character receives a GM intrusion on their next action (no matter what their roll is) and receives 1 XP to give away (but not one to keep).
>
> Alteration: Can turn any creature within short range into a different creature (such as a mouse into a horse) and any object into a similarly shaped object (such as a
>
> Prophecy: Creates a prediction for the future of a single person. The prediction has a high chance of coming true, but is not certain. (Prophecies work like GM intrusions that will take place in the future; the player can reject the prophecy by spending an XP.) Not all prophecies are negative.

Interaction: Interacting with fairy godmothers is usually a little frantic, frenzied, and full of “Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!” If they like you, they’re likely to prove a loyal, steadfast, and useful ally. If not, well, hopefully you like being turned into a horse, or worse.

Use: Fairy godmothers make great lighthearted additions to encounters, particularly ones where the characters are preparing for a ball, a fight, or a big adventure.

GM Intrusion: The fairy godmother’s magic goes awry and a character is accidentally turned into a horse.

Áine, Fairy Queen of Light an Love 9 (27)

Áine is the fairy queen of summer and the sun, and is known by many names: the Fairy Queen of Light and Love, Bright One, Sun Goddess, and Sweetheart of the Fairies. She is a kind, true, and benevolent ruler, and is loved by nearly everyone. Known for making just and fair bargains with humans, she is often sought after for blessings and boons.

Motive: To be just and true, to protect her realm

Environment: She shares a fairy realm with her sister, Gráinne, where she rules in the summer months. 

Health: 99

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short; very long when shapeshifted

Combat: Áine rarely engages in combat herself, as she prefers to leave that role to her son

Geroid and his army. However, if she’s attacked or feels the need to defend her realm or someone in it, she will not hesitate to step in. She attacks using the power of the sun, focusing light into a narrow beam that inflicts 12 points of damage on the target.

In addition, Áine has the power of chlorokineses—she can manipulate plants and flowers within very long range, causing them to grow to enormous proportions. She can use them as weapons that grab and hold multiple victims (level 7 Might task to break free) or that do damage via strangulation or thorns (7 points of damage). Any bees in the area act to help the queen.

> Queen’s bees: level 3; sting victims for 3 points of damage and paralyze

them for one round

She can also shapeshift into a red mare as she chooses. As a mare, she inflicts 6 points of damage with her hooves or bite, can become immaterial as an action (makes it impossible to successfully attack her, but she cannot attack in this form), and can move to a spot within long range instantaneously (does not require an action).

Interaction: Just, true, and kind, Áine makes a powerful ally, provided that she does not feel that she or her realm are threatened. Those who wish harm on others or who she sees as malevolent in action or thought are more likely to

find themselves on the wrong end of the Bright One’s anger.

Use: Characters who wish for something important in their lives to change may ask Áine to grant them a boon. She sometimes helps those in need without them asking for it (but, of course, only for a price). If the characters attend a fairy ball or feast, they may encounter Áine as an honored guest.

Loot: Áine wears a crown of glass, but it is not visible unless she chooses it to be (she rarely does) or she dies. She carries little else, for she is a person of deeds, not items.

GM intrusion: One of Áine’s ardent followers believes a character is threatening their beloved queen.

Gráinne, the Wayward Daughter 9 (27)

Gráinne is the Fairy Queen of Hope and Despair, sometimes also called the Wayward Daughter, the Winter Queen, and Dark One. Gráinne is to the dark what Áine is to the light. This doesn’t mean that Gráinne is evil, just that she represents what is good and bad in the world that is hidden in shadows, buried beneath the ground, and revealed at night. She has her own moral code, one that can work in the favor of those who are cunning and willing to look at the darkness of their own hearts.

Motive: To honor the darkness, to protect her realm

Environment: She shares a fairy realm with her sister, where she rules in winter. In the summer, she sleeps in the Sorrows, a belowground realm out of time and space. 

Health: 99

Damage Inflicted: 12 points

Armor: 5

Movement: Short; long when flying

Combat: Gráinne is a talented combatant, and seems to revel in having a foe who is a

challenge to her. She carries a dark green crystal staff that emits a dark coil of reddish energy, which inflicts 12 points of damage. Alternatively, she can send out a cloud of black smoke that deals 9 points of damage to all creatures in a short area. She also wears the Tiara of Pailis, a griffin-shaped tiara that allows her to fly. Gráinne has a variety of magical abilities at her disposal, including the following:

Animal Communication: Gráinne has a special affinity with badgers and can ask them for help. When she calls them (as an action), a cete of eight large badgers appears. They act as two level 4 creatures; attacked beings must also succeed on an Intellect defense roll or be shapeshifted into a badger for one round.

Oneirokinesis: Gráinne can infiltrate people’s dreams to converse with them. As such, she might implant an idea in their heads (such as “I’m going to die tonight” or “I should go back home”). When the character wakes, they must succeed on a level 6 Intellect defense roll to shake the idea. Otherwise, they feel a strong need to act on it, and are hindered in any tasks that go against the idea (this lasts until they make their next recovery roll).

Shadowmelding: Gráinne merges with shadows, making her nearly

intangible. In this form, she cannot be injured by physical attacks, and her attacks inflict 8 points of Intellect damage on anyone whose body is darkened by her shadow.

Interaction: For those who don’t mind a little darkness and moral ambiguity, Gráinne makes a powerful ally.

Use: The characters stumble into a fairy realm, only to be met by its just-woken guardian. Grieving characters may find the solutions and solace they seek in Gráinne’s magic and power.

Loot: Tiara of Pailis

Tiara of Pailis (artifact): level 7; allows the wearer to fly a long distance each round (as an action). The wearer can control their speed, direction, and height. Depletion: 1 in 1d20

GM Intrusion: A character’s companion animal or mount is affected by Gráinne’s animal affinity and falls under her power.

Queen 6 (18)

Ah, the Evil Queen. Ruler of the land, watcher in the mirror. Full of magic, utterly merciless, and sharp of tongue. Evil and wicked queens abound in fairy tales, from those who have no names and are remembered only for their evil deeds, to those whose names will never be forgotten: Queen Grimhilde, Maleficent, the Queen of Hearts, and the White Witch. These queens seek power for power’s sake, not caring what destruction lies in their wake.

Of course, not all queens are evil—just the ones you hear about most often. But they are all powerful in their own way, even if they are forced to hide it by their circumstances. While they too crave power, they seek it in order to protect their lands, their people, and their loved ones.

Motive: Power

Environment: Anywhere, but typically in cities and towns, where there are people to admire

and fear them 

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Combat: Queens almost always carry an artifact of great power, such as a staff, crown,

mirror, or sword, that grants them unique abilities and skills.

Queens often have familiars, such as ravens, who fight for or beside them. Most familiars can do 4 points of damage with an attack.

Some queens may also be witches or fey creatures, and thus have the ability to use one or two spells and curses that witches and fey also use.

Queen Grimhilde 8 (24)

Perhaps best known for her attempts to kill Snow White through magic and poison, Grimhilde has other passions and talents as well. She seeks ways to make all beings obey her commands, starting with the huntsman who so stupidly and willfully deceived her so long ago.

Environment: One of her many castles, the woods

Armor: 2

Health: 18

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Combat: Her vulture familiars swirl about all foes in short range, knocking them prone

and inflicting 4 points of damage. She can use the following witch abilities: glamour,

imprison, and seduce.

Vulture familiars: level 4

Interaction: Grimhilde is cunning and devious, always hatching plans against those who

harm her, who threaten to overshadow her, or who have caught her eye in some way. 

Use: The characters enter an area that is under Grimhilde’s power and must face her wrath. 

Loot: She has a mirror mirror artifact, as well as 1d6 cyphers (often poison).

The Red Queen 6 (18)

The Red Queen has never once yelled “Off with her head!” In fact, she has never yelled. It’s horrible manners, and besides, when you know how to wield power, you don’t need all that noise and chaos. You need only whisper and be still, and everyone will politely fall quiet and listen.

Environment: Polite dinner parties and social gatherings

Armor: 1

Combat: Prefers verbal sparring over the physical sort, and inflicts 3 points of damage with a single cutting remark or sharp-tongued retort.

Interaction: The Red Queen is quite proper and chatty, the perfect host and the perfect guest. The only time she ever grows irate is when the subject of her sister, the Queen of Hearts, comes up.

Use: While attending a party to steal something, the characters are caught by the Red Queen

The Snow Queen

The Snow Queen rules over the “snow bees”—snowflakes that look like bees. She keeps an ornate palace surrounded by gardens in the lands of permafrost, but she can be seen elsewhere in the world where snowflakes cluster. Most say she is cold, and they would be right. She has been part of the snow for so long that it’s possible she no longer remembers warmth or kindness or love.

Environment: Anywhere there is snow, ice, or winter

Armor: 2 (from personal ice walls)

Combat: Creates a snowstorm that blinds all foes in long range for three rounds; ice shards rain down upon all foes in long range, inflicting 2 points of damage; reindeer familiar inflicts 5 points of damage with her horns.

Interaction: The Snow Queen is not evil—she just has forgotten what it means to be human, with human needs and human hearts (not that she was ever truly human, but that’s a story for another time). She is willing to bargain if she understands what she gets out of it.

Use: The Snow Queen guards the entrance to a place the characters need to enter.

## OF WATER AND WAVES (CREATURES)

Creatures of water and waves are those that inhabit or are deeply tied to the rivers, ocean, marshes, and other watery areas of the world.

Drowning Fairies: There are many types of creatures known as “drowning fairies,” including Peg Powler, the Water Leaper, Fossegrim, and Jenny Greenteeth. These creatures typically dwell below or next to water and tempt, pull, or trick passersby into the water.

Level 6, persuasion and creating illusions as level 7; can grab a creature in short range and pull them into and under the water and attempt to drown them (level 6 Might or Speed defense task to break free)

Fuath: Fuathan are intangible spirits that dwell deep in the seas and oceans. They consider themselves protectors of these realms, particularly against fishermen and others who would damage the environment or creatures there. Fuathan have the power to make themselves visible, most often taking the form of humanoid creatures with green skin and the flowing mane and tail of a golden horse.

Level 5, defense as level 7 due to intangibility; if they know a person’s name, they can gain control over the person, forcing them to do their bidding for a short time

Naiad: These water nymphs inhabit rivers, springs, waterfalls, and other bodies of fresh water. Typically appearing as beautiful young women with long limbs and flowing hair, naiads are considered protectors, for they guard their land fiercely. However, they are easily provoked and their wrath is fierce.

Level 4; can cause water to boil, inflicting 3 points of heat damage on foes; can unleash flash floods that sweep all foes back a very long distance and inflict 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor)

Cailleach 5 (15)

Not actually a water spirit, but one who has made her peace with the sea in an eternal bargain, Cailleach once lived on land. Now she is a recluse deep in the ocean in the realm known as the Expanse of Halirane. She appears ancient, and in fact is much older than that. She shaves her head bald, wears dozens of shell earrings in each ear, and has a glass eye that allows her to see three views of the future. As part of her bargain with the sea, she can never return to dry land again, or she will lose all of her powers forever.

Motive: To be left alone

Environment: A home hidden inside a coral reef at the bottom of the ocean. Her home is a large dead whale that the sea magically preserves as part of their bargain. 

Health: 30

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Short; very long when shapeshifted

Modifications: Seeing through deceptions and lies as level 6, healing as level 8

Combat: Cailleach has many abilities at her disposal, some of which come from the sea and

others that come from her own magic. They include the following:

Healing Pot: If she has the proper ingredients and takes a day to do so, Cailleach can brew a healing salve in her special pot. Depending on what she adds to the mixture, this salve can do one of three things: restore 10 Might points, move someone up one step on the damage track, or remove a curse (up to level 6).

Reptilian Form: Cailleach takes the form of a reptile of any size. While in this form, she has +3 Armor and does 6 points of damage with her bite, claw, or tail lash. In addition, she regains 3 points of health per round.

Restore to Life: Putting her wizened pointer finger into someone’s mouth can bring them back to life, but only if they’ve been dead for less than a day and only if she holds her finger there for exactly as long as they’ve been dead. After that, her finger falls off. It takes three days for her to regrow a new one.

See the Future: Cailleach can use her glass eye to scry the future of an individual. She does so by first removing the eye, and then having the person hold it in their mouth until she asks for it back (sometimes this is for just a second, and sometimes it’s for hours—it’s hard to know if the variable length of time is part of the ritual or just her dark sense of humor). She typically sees three possible futures, and all of them have an equal chance of coming to pass.

Wanton Destruction: As part of her agreement with the sea, Cailleach was given the power to control small parts of it at a time. She can create a whirlpool that catches up all creatures and objects within short range of its center and inflicts 5 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).

Interaction: Cailleach is a recluse and introvert whose deepest longing is to be left alone

to increase her knowledge of magic. She also likes puzzles and games, and out of everything on land, she misses birds most of all (for interacting with, not eating). Those who bring her any of those items are likely to draw Cailleach out of her shell and have a positive interaction.

Use: Cailleach can be a beneficial ally, particularly as a healer. She might also be convinced to help fight against an encroaching danger, especially if it’s threatening her solitude and privacy.

Loot: She typically carries a number of sea cyphers, and her home is filled with books, scrolls, and journals of all sorts.

GM intrusion: The sea offers additional assistance to Cailleach’s spells, increasing her damage or movement.

Kelpie 6 (18)

A sinister aquatic creature that takes the shape of a grey horse or white pony, the kelpie lures unsuspecting passersby and attempts to drown them in a nearby body of water.

Some kelpies look just like horses. Others look as if they’re created from elements of the swamp—maybe its tail is algae, its mane cattails, its eyes glowing pebbles or miniature moons. Maybe eels and snails and other creatures are its teeth or tongue. One thing about kelpies is always true: their manes are always dripping and their hooves are always inverted.

If someone knows a kelpie’s name and says it aloud, the kelpie loses all its power over that person and retreats to the depths of the water.

Motive: Unknown

Environment: Near or in rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of running or still water.

Modern settings might find them near public or private swimming pools, koi ponds,

and reservoirs. 

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Very long when running

Combat: When a passerby approaches, the kelpie might appear tame, a little lost, injured,

or otherwise friendly and in need. Or, if the passerby appears weary or sad, the kelpie will offer a ride upon their back. The kelpie’s sticky skin traps the rider (level 7 Might task to break free). Once the rider is seated, the kelpie may attempt to drown them in the lake, run so fast that the rider takes 5 points of Intellect damage from fright, or roll over on them, inflicting 4 points of damage (ignores Armor).

Interaction: Not all kelpies are malevolent. Some were once “tamed” by someone who learned their names and loved them. These kelpies actively seek out human contact, attempting to find someone to replace the one they loved.

Use: In the gloom, a large black horse appears, wearing beautiful tack and acting as if lost. It offers one of the weary characters a ride upon its back.

GM intrusion: While dealing with something else, the characters come upon a kelpie in the process of drowning someone.

The West Wind 9 (27)

The West Wind has no master, no shackles, no chains. She goes where she will, and woe to those who try to capture or hold her. When she’s not blowing through the sky, she takes the shape of a human woman dressed in a sparkling blue tuxedo, her short silver hair pushed back from her face.

Not all winds are living creatures. Sometimes the wind is just the wind. But you won’t know which is which until you try to talk with it.

Motive: To stave off boredom by playing tricks, traveling, stirring up trouble, and helping others

Environment: Anywhere she wants to be 

Health: 40

Damage Inflicted: 6 points

Movement: Very long

Modifications: Speed defense as level 10; sees through and resists trickery, lies, deceit, and intimidation as level 10

Combat: Inflicts 6 points of damage to every creature and object she chooses within a very long distance, and knocks them prone.

Interaction: Some say the West Wind is cold, but she’s really just an introvert and prefers to spend most of her time traveling alone. However, she’s actually very warm hearted and is likely to help those in need. She does not respond well to trickery, traps, or attempts to force her hand (unless they’re terribly clever or smart, and then she admits grudging respect for the perpetrators).

Use: The characters need the West Wind’s help to travel somewhere, knock something down, or retrieve something from a hidden place. Someone needs an elegant date to a royal ball or a fairy festival.

Loot: Sometimes the West Wind picks up interesting things on her travels. She may gift allies these items, including cyphers, artifacts, and even creatures.

GM intrusion: The West Wind lifts a character high in the air and threatens to let them fall.

Wind Children 4 (12)

The children of the wind cannot be measured in known numbers, for they are here and there and everywhere. They are not born, so much as borne, by weather patterns, wishes, and wants. Dust devils, gales, and zephyrs are all wind children.

Motive: See everything, know everything

Environment: Everywhere there is weather, real or magic-made 

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Long

Combat: Inflicts 4 points of damage with an exhale. Alternatively, can knock a character prone for one round.

Interaction: Interacting with wind children is a bit like interacting with a group of mischievous, precocious, and spoiled kids. However, they know many things, having been all over the world, and will often share what they know in exchange for new secrets or knowledge.

Use: One of the PCs seeks information about a person, place, or thing. The characters need a surreptitious spy to gather information for them.

Loot: Information, secrets, and possibly a cypher or two picked up during their travels.

GM intrusion: The wind children grab something precious from one of the characters and start to play a game of “keep away” with it.

Witch 5 (15)

Witches are complex beings of myriad personalities, desires, and abilities. Sometimes they’re the stuff of nightmares, with tales of their exploits keeping children safe in their beds during the darkest hours. Other times they’re wise helpers—at least for a little

while, or possibly for a price. Often, they’re a little of everything, taking on no end of roles throughout their lifetime. They may isolate themselves deep in the dark woods, falsify their way into a royal family, or reside in the middle of town, hiding their identity.

But one thing they are, always, is dangerous, for they carry within their hearts and heads knowledge, power, and magic—and a willingness to use all of them when necessary. Motive: Domination of others, power, knowledge, eternal life or beauty, hunger, revenge Environment: Almost anywhere, although most often alone in unique dwellings in the

forest, in civilization as healers, or having infiltrated royal families 

Health: 21

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Movement: Short; long if flying

Combat: In addition to inflicting damage with their weapon of choice (often a staff or long,

curved blade), witches can curse their enemies.

They also have a number of spells and abilities at their disposal. These include the

Following:

Familiar: When attacked, a witch relies on the aid of their familiar to improve their Speed

defense. The familiar could be a large black cat, an owl, a big snake, or some other creature. Killing a witch’s familiar is so shocking to a witch that their attacks and Speed defense are hindered for a few days. It’s also a way to ensure that the witch never forgives their foe or grants mercy.

Glamour: Glamour is an illusion that the witch creates. It may let them look like someone else, appear to be a tree or a bird, or even make them invisible. Seeing through the glamour is a level 8 Intellect task. A failed attempt inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Once a character sees through the glamour, they cannot unsee it.

Heal: The witch touches another creature and heals them for 6 points of damage. Some witches must pull health from another living being in long range in order to use this ability. Pulling health from a living being inflicts 2 points of damage on that being.

Imprison: The witch creates a prison within long range and captures a foe inside it as a single action. The prison might be physical (a tower, a cage, a trap, a binding around the body) or mental (they can’t move, their muscles are no longer under their control, they are afraid to move). Resisting being caught is a level 5 defense task (Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the type of imprisonment). If a character is caught, breaking free is a level 5 task (of the appropriate stat).

Protect: Places a confinement spell to keep someone from going in or out of a location, building, or room. Those who attempt to pass through the spell but fail take 3 points of Intellect damage and are knocked back. Once the spell activates, it disappears.

Revive: This rare and costly ability allows a witch to bring someone back to life, as long as they haven’t been dead for more than a year. In order to accomplish this, the witch needs all or part of the body of the dead, a beloved object of the dead’s, and the willingness of someone else to take on a curse that results from the magical working (roll on the Curse table to determine the resulting curse). Revive takes ten minutes to cast, and the character returns to life with 1 point in all of their Pools.

Seduce: Creatures within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll become enamored of the witch. Resisting the witch’s persuasion attempts is hindered by two steps until the victim succeeds on an Intellect defense roll; each time they fail to resist the persuasion attempt, the witch’s next persuasion attempt is eased by an additional step.

Additional abilities: Witches might also have access to the witch abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook. These are charm, hexbolt, shrivel, and vitality. Some witches might have other magical abilities similar to those of enchanters.

GM intrusions: The witch’s familiar joins the fray, tripping up characters and hindering their actions.

> Something startles the witch and they cast a curse or spell as an automatic response. The witch pulls out an artifact or cypher and prepares to use it.

## WITCHES OF THE WORLD

Baba Yaga 9 (27)

Baba Yaga (sometimes called Frau Trude) lives many lives and has many personalities. She is both one witch and many. She uses her magic to create a new version of herself each time her

life takes a new branch, following all of them at once, becoming every version of herself that she might have been.

Some versions of Baba Yaga are helpful. Others harmful. Some Baba Yagas live

in the woods in a wooden hut that walks around on giant chicken legs, some

fly through the sky in a giant mortar and pestle, and some guard any wild spaces that they have deemed important. Some capture and cook young children in a special stove. Some do all of the above.

Combat: Baba Yaga can use the following abilities: heal, hexbolt, imprison, protect, revive, shrivel, and vitality.

Interaction: It is almost impossible to know which Baba Yaga you have met until you look deep in her eyes (a level 7 Intellect task). There, you might see a tiny flame, and in that flame, learn a bit about her life.

Use: Baba Yaga has her long, bony fingers in nearly everything that happens. She might be behind the counter at the herb and potion shop, guarding the entrance to a cave full of treasure, or offering her services in breaking (or casting) curses.

Loot: 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and various other odds and ends

The Blind Witch 5 (15)

The Blind Witch is skinny and always hungry. She lives deep in the forest in a house made of confectionery, which allows her to catch, fatten, and eventually eat any children unlucky enough to get caught in her trap.

Modifications: Cooking as level 6, deception and trickery as level 7, seeing through

deception and trickery as level 4

Combat: She can use the following abilities: charm, protect, and vitality. She is immune to visual effects, including hallucinations.

Interaction: The Blind Witch can appear sweet and charming, and might play up her blindness and apparent frailty for sympathy.

Use: Characters wandering the woods might come upon a candy house, and woe to them

should they take a bite. A rescue mission could lead here.

Loot: She usually has at least one magical animal in a cage, along with various children and

even adults. Two or three cyphers can be found in her kitchen, along with her magic oven, which bakes children into gingerbread.

Dame Gothel 5 (15)

Sometimes taking the form of a young woman and sometimes an old one, Dame Gothel cares for one thing above all: her beautiful walled garden, the flowers and vegetables that grow inside it being the envy of all others. Unlike many other witches, she does not harm children and in fact has been known to protect them, at least as long as they are innocent of wrongdoing.

Modifications: Gardening and potions as level 6

Combat: She can use the following abilities: heal, imprison, protect, and shrivel. 

Interaction: Dame Gothel is an introvert who mostly desires to be left alone, and woe be

to those who invade her space in any way, for she has a deep sense of right and wrong and a penchant for revenge upon those who cross her. However, she has been known to help those seeking aid, and is particularly skilled in using what she grows in her garden to aid her magic.

Use: The characters need a concoction to heal someone, remove a curse, or help them get pregnant. The characters accidentally trespass on Dame Gothel’s space.

Loot: Various plants, potions, and cyphers

The Sea Witch 6 (18)

Living in the darkest depths of the sea, the Sea Witch is dangerous, wily, persuasive, and scheming. She is best known for brewing up life options—for a price. If you want what she’s got (and she’s got everything), you bring her what she wants. It might be your voice, your hair, or your firstborn. Or all three. Surely you won’t miss them . . .

Modifications: Persuasion, intimidation, coercion, and swimming as level 8

Combat: She can use the following abilities: charm, familiar (water snakes), glamour, imprison, protect, seduce, and shrivel.

Interaction: The Sea Witch will always make a bargain, take a bet, gamble all she’s got on

the downtrodden and woe-be-gotten. Not because her heart is big, but because she makes sure that the house—that’s her—always wins.

Use: The characters need a potion, a spell, a curse, or any other bit of magic, large or

small, and the Sea Witch will find a way to put it in their hands and let them walk away

thinking they’ve come out ahead. At least until she comes to collect.

Loot: A chest full of gifts and winnings from lovers, fawners, and those who should have known better, including 1d6 cyphers and two artifacts.

The Wicked Witch of the West 5 (15)

With her three pigtails and diminutive stature, it would be easy to write off the Wicked Witch of the West as a nobody—and many have—but her power lies in the creatures that work for her and in her vast and growing collection of magical footwear.

She can see up to 2 miles (3 km) away with her single eye, and wears galoshes that give her +2 Armor against water and liquid of all kinds.

Modifications: Tasks involving water and the dark as level 3

Combat: She carries an umbrella that acts as a heavy weapon, and she can use the following abilities: familiar (pack of wolves, swarm of bees, flock of crows, and an army

of flying monkeys), hexbolt, imprison, protect, and shrivel.

Interaction: She is volatile in nature and quick to anger. However, she can also be a bit cowardly, and will likely back down in a confrontation (only to send her hordes of magical animals out afterward to do her dirty work).

Use: The characters need to find galoshes of fortune and decide to steal a pair from the Wicked Witch of the West. Perhaps they need to make it through the land she presides over and must find a way to get her approval.

Loot: Whatever shoes she’s wearing (which are very likely an artifact).

## NPCS

MODERN MAGIC NPCs

CHANGELING 3 (9)

Fey creatures sometimes kidnap a human child and leave a changeling in its place, tricking the human parents into raising an inhuman creature as their own offspring. The changeling has a foot in two worlds, living as a spy or sleeper agent for the fey, but thoroughly enjoying their life among humans.

Motive: Serving the fey; finding their place in the world

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Might defense as level 2; deception, disguise, and stealth as level 4

Combat: Changelings use human weapons.

A changeling can use an action to alter their appearance for a minute or so to match that of someone they’ve seen. This is a reasonable likeness, although they may not know their target’s mannerisms, accent, and other nonphysical qualities.

Some changelings are vulnerable to iron, taking an extra 1 point of damage from any iron or steel weapon.

Interaction: Changelings aren’t inherently untruthful or untrustworthy, but sometimes they can’t help but embellish a fact or take advantage of a situation. They otherwise act like regular people, but spending enough time with them usually reveals an odd quirk or attitude.

Use: An acquaintance is having trouble at home (because their family realized they’re a changeling). Someone suspects a family member is actually a changeling.

Loot: Changelings have the same kinds of personal items that humans do, but they often have a token or other treasured thing that doesn’t quite belong (and might secretly be a cypher or artifact).

CORPORATE MAGE 4 (12)

A corporate mage is a professional spellcaster working for a company, using their magic to fix problems. They have a similar role as enforcers, lawyers, corporate spies, and researchers, doing what needs to be done so the company’s interests are protected. They’re paid well, dress to show it, and aren’t above unethical (or even illegal) acts to get the job done. They work alone, in pairs, or with a lawyer and a few bodyguards.

Lawyer: level 2, law and intimidation as level 4

Bodyguard: level 2; Armor 1; short-range pistol inflicts 4 damage

Stats for a corporate mage also work well for paranormal law enforcement NPCs, such as the police or FBI.

Motive: Accomplish the goals of their employer

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Armor: 1 (from spell)

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intellect defense as level 5

Combat: Corporate mages are trained to handle normal people and magic threats, and they usually attack with a short-range blast of cold, fire, force, or electricity. Some carry a concealed handgun for situations where magic isn’t allowed or effective.

A corporate mage knows quite a few spells, including knocking a person unconscious for a few minutes, turning invisible for a few minutes, temporarily befriending a reluctant person, creating an illusory disguise of a nondescript role (such as construction worker or technician), granting themselves +1 Armor, reading minds, and teleporting back to headquarters. Many of them have some training in law, espionage, governmental operations, or a scientific field.

Interaction: Corporate mages are hard and intimidating. If they can get what they want without using magic, they’ll do so, but they aren’t afraid to make a demonstration of supernatural force when necessary.

Use: Corporate mages do the dirty work of sketchy businesses. They’re not here to make friends, and they know just how far to push someone (especially a powerless person) to get what they want, sometimes by bending (but not quite breaking) the law.

Loot: A corporate mage usually has a cypher that’s helpful for their current assignment, plus the cash equivalent of one or two expensive items.

DEMON HUNTER 3 (9)

In a world where demons, witches, and other evil magical creatures are free to prey upon humanity, hunters are one of the few things that keep them in check. They usually have to keep their work secret and are slow to trust anyone, but once befriended they have a habit of showing up just when help is needed.

Depending on the setting, a demon hunter might hunt demons, vampires, witches, or all supernatural creatures.

> Exceptional hunter: level 5; attacks and Intellect defense as level 6; perception, tracking, and creature lore as level 7; health 20; attacks deal 6 damage

Motive: Hunt down and defeat their chosen foes

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 4 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Attacks and Intellect defense as level 4; perception, tracking, and creature lore as level 5

Combat: A typical hunter is weaker than the average demon or witch, and prefers to outwit their foes rather than engage in a straight-up fight. Knowing this, they pick their battles carefully and use ambush tactics and strength of numbers—either another hunter or several support characters such as priests and soldiers—to help defeat their foes. A hunter usually has a good idea of their opponent’s strengths and weaknesses, and they plan and react accordingly.

Interaction: Many novice hunters are overconfident and condescending. Others (especially the more experienced ones) are paranoid and hardened by battle and the deaths of too many friends. They react positively if given respect.

Use: A couple of rough-looking drifters arrive in a classic car, looking for trouble. Someone who seems to be a meek professor turns out to secretly be a hunter.

Loot: Hunters carry equipment needed for their job, cash, and perhaps an old book (cypher) with an ability relevant to their current prey.

Priest: level 2, religious lore and all interaction tasks as level 6

Soldier: level 3, perception as level 4; health 12; Armor 1; attacks inflict 5 damage

PHARMACEUTICAL SORCERER 3 (9)

A pharmaceutical sorcerer is an apothecary, doctor, dentist, magical healer, counselor, surgeon, and nutritionist all in one. They have devoted themselves to the art and science of healing, using a combination of methods to achieve remarkable success. Some work in drugstores, some have their own specialized businesses, and some administer aid from their homes or a public clinic. They might wear medical scrubs or a white coat over normal clothing.

Assistant: level 2, healing as level 3

Motive: Healing and promoting good health

Health: 9

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Medicine, herbs, and healing as level 5

Combat: Pharmaceutical sorcerers prefer to avoid combat, but they can attack with short-range nonlethal spells or drugs that inflict 4 points of Might or Intellect damage (ignores Armor).

A pharmaceutical sorcerer knows several spells, such as healing a touched creature for 4 health or Pool points, identifying diseases and afflictions, removing or ameliorating afflictions and chronic conditions for a day, or making a patient feel relaxed and safe for a few hours. They’re usually licensed and trained to perform minor medical procedures such as administering vaccines, applying topical medicines, and splinting broken bones.

A pharmaceutical sorcerer often has one or more assistants, protégés, or students who help with clients or other aspects of running their health practice. They are generally on good terms with doctors, licensed therapists, nurses, magic-using priests, and other professionals in the health field.

Interaction: Pharmaceutical sorcerers are compassionate, intelligent, and well-informed. They want to help people, but sometimes are stymied by paperwork, laws, and lack of money.

Use: Pharmaceutical sorcerers are usually support characters using their magic to heal others and prevent harm. Their extensive knowledge of helpful magic, medicinal herbs, and health science makes them useful for diagnosing strange symptoms and ruling out minor afflictions to find the real cause of a problem.

Loot: In addition to standard medicines, handheld medical tools, and herbs and drugs, the sorcerer might have a healing cypher or some interesting payment from a patient.

FANTASY NPCs

BARD 3 (9)

A bard uses the power of words and music to create magic that inspires and influences others. A typical bard plays a musical instrument and weaves song-spells that rival the magic of wizards and priests, but some use their voices, creating fascinating tales and dramatic speeches. 

Motive: Entertainment, interaction, and novel experiences 

Health: 10 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Music, oration, persuasion, stealth, and Speed defense as level 4 

Combat: Bards prefer weapons that rely on speed and agility, like daggers, rapiers, and small bows. Every other round, a bard can create a blast of pure sound that inflicts 3 points of damage (ignores Armor) to one target within short range. 

A bard knows several spells, such as adding +1 to recovery rolls of nearby creatures, making an indifferent creature friendly (or a hostile one indifferent) for a few minutes, deafening one opponent for hours, easing a physical task by two steps, turning invisible for a minute, or negating sound for a minute. 

Interaction: Bards are personable and easy to talk to, but they have a sharp wit and a sharper tongue when it comes to critics and tyrants. A bard would rather escape from a dangerous situation than fight to the death. 

Use: A bard ally often has useful information about the current situation, drawn from songs and folk tales. In a pinch, they can make do as a scout or spy, especially in an urban setting. An unfriendly bard mocks the characters and turns the will of a crowd against them. 

Loot: In addition to a musical instrument and a nice outfit for performing, bards usually have currency equivalent to a moderately priced item and one or two cyphers.

BERSERKER 3 (9)

A berserker is a fierce warrior who can fly into a rage, greatly increasing their strength and hardiness. Many of them choose an animal such as a bear, wolf, or boar as their spiritual kin, wearing the skin of that animal and fighting like wild beasts. 

Motive: Glory in battle 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 (or 3 when berserk) 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Climbing, jumping, running, and Speed defense as level 4 

Combat: Berserkers prefer large, heavy weapons such as axes, hammers, and greatswords, but they may use bows if they can’t easily get close to their foes. 

A berserker can enter a state of rage as part of their action. When raging, they gain +1 to Armor (including against fire), their melee attacks inflict an additional 2 points of damage, and their attacks, Might defense, and actions relying on strength (such as climbing and jumping) are eased by two steps. However, their Speed defense is hindered. A raging berserker fights only with melee weapons and won’t retreat from battle.

 Interaction: Berserkers are the elites of some warrior cultures and enjoy physical competitions such as wrestling, throwing heavy items, and feasting. They dislike weak and cowardly folk, and do not tolerate insults to their strength or honor. 

Use: A group of warriors is led by a mighty berserker looking for a challenging fight. A group of berserkers enters town and picks fights with the local toughs. 

Loot: In addition to their weapons and light armor, a berserker has one or two moderately priced items. The leader of a group might have a cypher that enhances strength or toughness.

DRUID 4 (12)

A druid is a servant of a nature deity or the entirety of nature itself. Some have specific interests such as animals, plants, or storms, with greater powers relating to that devotion. Druids are leaders and advisors in some cultures, society-hating hermits in others. 

Motive: Protecting nature 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Nature lore, perception, and stealth as level 5 

Combat: Druids use simple weapons crafted out of natural materials, such as spears, slings, and bows, as well as ritual tools such as daggers and sickles. 

A druid knows several spells, such as a short-range attack that uses electricity or fire, healing a touched creature for 4 health, calming and befriending animals, traveling quickly, controlling the weather within long range, transforming into an animal or plant, and manipulating the natural elements. A druid often has a loyal animal companion, such as a black bear, hawk, viper, or wolf. 

Interaction: Druids are cautious when dealing with city folk, and they act quickly to stop the reckless use of fire or exploitation of the wilds. They are generally on good terms with local animals and magical creatures of nature (faeries, sapient trees, satyrs, and so on). 

Use: A hermit druid comes to the aid of injured or lost characters in the wildlands. A druid has been attacking loggers and hunters who stray too far from civilization. 

Loot: In addition to weapons, light armor, and some moderately priced ritual items, a druid might have a couple of cyphers or perhaps an artifact.

DWARF 4(12)

A typical dwarf found outside of their homeland is an explorer, warrior, and tradesperson of some skill. Dwarves travel to find work as mercenaries, sell the goods they create, or find unusual materials to use in their crafting. 

Motive: Defense, loyalty, honor 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 2 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Crafting (metal or stone), Intellect defense, and Might defense as level 5 

Combat: Dwarves traditionally use weapons like axes, hammers, and crossbows. They’re used to working together to defend their halls; three or more dwarves attacking the same target act as a level 6 creature that inflicts 8 points of damage. 

Dwarf leaders are usually officers or priests.

 Interaction: Dwarves are proud and hardworking, but they tend to be stubborn, gruff, and unforgiving of offenses to them or their clan. It takes time to gain their trust, but they respect a fair deal, a hard bargain, a sharp axe, and a sturdy hammer. 

Use: A stoic old dwarf is looking to go on one more quest before retiring. A clan of dwarves seeks a trade agreement with a human city leader—or redress for an old insult.

Loot: In addition to their weapons and light or medium armor, a dwarf probably has several moderately priced items (such as tools or exploration gear) and perhaps a cypher or two.

ELF 4 (12)

An elf has a very long lifespan and tends to learn and abandon many skills and interests, including combat and magic. Elves are likely to wander in pursuit of something new and interesting, such as finding the tallest tree in the forest, the most beautiful sunset, or the perfect love song. 

Motive: Curiosity 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Perception, Speed defense, and any two noncombat skills as level 5 

Combat: Elves usually fight with short or medium blades and delicate but deadly bows. Because of their subtle skill and fast reactions, their first attack in any combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage. 

A typical elf might know a few minor spells, such as heating or chilling food, creating a bit of moonlight, and cleaning or repairing clothing.

Interaction: Elves appreciate beauty, grace, and skill, and they don’t respond well to crudeness or bluster, especially from people decades or centuries younger than themselves. They are subtle in their insults but do have a sense of humor. 

Use: A group of young elves arrives in a city, wanting to see firsthand how the short-lived humans do things. An elf is said to have lived in the forest for a thousand years, listening to the secrets whispered by the trees.

Loot: In addition to their weapons and light armor, an elf carries a few moderately priced (but extremely well-made) curios and mementos, and usually a cypher.

HALFLING 3 (9)

A halfling is fond of the comforts of home, but adventures and exploration are the fodder of great stories told over tea or dinner, or in a fireside chat. Quick, resourceful, and easy to get along with, halflings fit right in with brave big folk as scouts, burglars, and loyal companions. 

Motive: Defense, comfort 

Health: 9 

Damage Inflicted: 3 points 

Armor: 0 or 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Intellect defense, pleasant social interactions, and stealth as level 4 

Combat: Halflings are remarkably skilled with knives, clubs, slings, and small bows. They prefer not to fight larger creatures head on; instead they stay at range, plan ambushes to quickly overwhelm opponents, or team up with a larger ally so they can attack a foe’s back and legs.

Interaction: Halflings enjoy the company of larger folks as long as they aren’t mocked for their size. They’re brave and determined when they need to be, though some might complain about wanting to go home. 

Use: A young halfling wants to have some adventures before settling down. The local thieves’ guild is said to employ halflings as lookouts and cutpurses, sometimes disguised as human children. 

Loot: In addition to their weapons (and perhaps some light armor) and food, a halfling might have an interesting cypher or two. Most carry several useful moderately priced items, or an expensive item such as an heirloom snuff box or a nice bag of tools.

PALADIN 4 (12)

Paladins are heroes who swear a holy oath to vanquish evil. Their power and righteousness are a gift and a heavy burden, and most of them expect to die in battle against an evil foe. 

Motive: Protecting the innocent, destroying evil 

Health: 15 

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Armor: 2 or 3 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Attacks and Might defense as level 5 

Combat: Paladins like flashy weapons and shiny armor, which help them show their devotion to the ideals of goodness and draw the attention of evil foes. Many choose a two-handed weapon, but some prefer using a shield in their off hand (defense-oriented paladins like these inflict only 4 points of damage with their attacks but gain an asset on Speed defense). 

Blessed by the powers of good, paladins can draw on innate holy magic for several purposes, such as detecting the presence of supernatural evil (demons, evil dragons, undead, and so on), restoring 4 health to themselves or a touched creature, smiting an evil foe to inflict an additional 4 points of damage, or breaking free of mind control. 

Interaction: Paladins have big personalities and strongly believe in their purpose and goals. They have no tolerance for evil acts and are unwilling to look the other way when their allies want to bend the rules or take advantage of a “grey area.” However, they are not fools and won’t throw away their lives for nothing. 

Use: A paladin lays claim to a foe the characters are seeking or have captured. An old paladin is looking for one last villain to smite. 

Loot: In addition to their weapons and armor, paladins might have one or two cyphers. More experienced ones might be lucky enough to have an artifact (usually a weapon or armor).

THIEF 4 (12)

A thief takes things that don’t belong to them—preferably with their victim remaining unaware of the crime until the thief is safely away. Burglars and pickpockets are the most common sort, but ambitious thieves are known to plan elaborate heists to steal priceless items from prominent targets. 

Motive: Greed, curiosity, risk 

Health: 12 

Damage Inflicted: 4 points 

Armor: 1 

Movement: Short 

Modifications: Balancing, climbing, perception, pickpocketing, and stealth as level 5 

Combat: Thieves prefer small concealable weapons—knives, batons, and so on—so they can quickly make themselves look like an innocent bystander. Their goal is to escape, not kill, so they often rely on tricks like caltrops, spilled oil, and smoke pellets to distract or delay foes and give themselves an opportunity to get away. They aren’t above using poison, typically a sleep poison that knocks out a foe for ten minutes on a failed Might defense task.

 Interaction: Thieves run a broad range of personalities—nervous, arrogant, quietly confident, sarcastic, and more. They like to know the risks and rewards of what they’ll be doing, and they don’t like surprises. 

Use: A cocky thief steals an item from a character and returns it to prove their skills are up to the task. A gang of pickpockets targets a character’s jewelry or cyphers. 

Loot: Thieves usually carry light tools, a few small weapons, miscellaneous equipment for creating a distraction, and a cypher they plan to use or sell.

HORROR NPCs 

Cannibal 3 (9)

A cannibal is someone who has decided that eating other people is not only necessary but desirable. Whether this decision was forced by circumstance or made out of some secret, maladaptive urge, cannibals are dangerous because they hide in plain sight, pretending friendship and aid for strangers until their prey lowers their guard. That’s when a cannibal strikes. Some cannibals like it raw; others delight in elaborate preparations.

Motive: Hungers for human flesh 

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points 

Movement: Short

Modifications: Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and tasks related to friendly interaction as level 6

Combat: Cannibals use whatever weapon is at hand. They usually don’t attack unless they can surprise their prey. When cannibals have surprise, they attack as level 5 creatures and inflict 2 additional points of damage.

Interaction: Cannibals seem friendly and charming until they decide you are for dinner. Use: Characters looking for a place to sleep, hide, or stay for the night are invited in by one

or more cannibals—perhaps an entire family of them.

Loot: A cannibal has currency equivalent to a very expensive item and possibly a cypher.

GM intrusion: The cannibal reveals a severed and gnawed- upon body part of a previous victim. The character must succeed on an Intellect defense task or be stunned and lose their next turn.

Mad Scientist 4 (12)

A mad scientist is someone who delves into areas of science best left unexamined, abandoning ethics and pushing for what can be created without asking if it should be. 

Motive: Understanding and exploiting reality

Environment: Usually in a lab

Health: 15

Damage Inflicted: 7 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Defends as level 6 due to a gadget (or cypher); knowledge of advanced

science as level 7

Combat: Mad scientists are usually accompanied by security guards, robots, zombies, or

some other appropriate creature. A mad scientist can attempt to take command of an enemy’s technological device (armor, a weapon, a cypher, a robot, and so on) within short range for up to one minute using a handheld device.

Mad scientists usually have access to a long-range energy or high-velocity weapon that inflicts 7 points of damage. They often carry manifest cyphers that increase Armor, confuse opponents’ senses, or transform themselves into a form that eases all their actions by two steps.

Interaction: Mad scientists are narcissistic and love to monologue about their work. They negotiate but usually are sociopathic and don’t care about other people. Some are filled with self-loathing but too far gone to feel they can change.

Use: Blackouts and strange noises have been traced to a location found to hold a secret lab where a scientist is creating something amazing and monstrous.

Loot: Mad scientists have a few manifest cyphers and possibly an artifact.

GM intrusion: The mad scientist produces a gadget or cypher that proves to be the perfect answer to a dilemma at hand.

## FAIRYTALE NPCS

The NPCs in the following section are general examples of nonmagical, mortal human characters that are commonly found in fairy tales.

From General to Specific: While the NPCs listed here are general types, such as crafter and robber, it’s easy to turn them into specific characters from common and well-known fairy tales. For example, with a little tweaking, you can turn a generic tailor into the tailor from The Brave Little Tailor. Just give the crafter NPC a banner that says “SEVEN WITH ONE BLOW” and embrace a jaunty, overconfident nature, and you have the titular character.

Health, Not Pools: Remember that NPCs don’t have stat Pools. Instead, they have a characteristic called health. When an NPC takes damage of any kind, the amount

is subtracted from their health. Unless described otherwise, an NPC’s health

is always equal to their target number. Some NPCs might have special reactions to or defenses against attacks that would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect damage, but unless the NPC’s description specifically explains this, assume that all damage is subtracted from the NPC’s health.

Naming Your NPCs: You might have noticed that in fairy tales, many characters —especially those of the lower or working classes—don’t have a name beyond their title, position, or profession (or sometimes their marriage status). “The Woodcutter,” “the Tailor,” “the Baker’s wife,” and so on. While you could follow suit and just call your NPC “the Woodcutter,” most player characters are going to ask that person their name. It’s likely to break immersion if you throw in a modern name, or if the NPC tries to explain that they don’t have one, they’re just called “the Woodcutter.” And if you call them all Jack, then no one (including you) will remember which one is which. Consider coming up with a list of names ahead of time so that you’re always ready to give players something to call a new walk-on character. 

Aristocrat 4 (12)

Aristocrats are not quite high royalty—they are not kings or queens, nor even princes and princesses—but they are those with money and power enough to wield in dangerous or glorious ways. Knights and barons are typically aristocrats, as are characters like Bluebeard and Mr. Fox. Some aristocrats, such as knights, may only want to do good and protect the things that matter to them. Others, of course, prefer to use the darker side of their privileged position.

Motive: Money, power, marriage, take who or what they want, protect what they care about Environment: Typically in cities and towns, occasionally off by themselves in large castles and manors 

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 5 points

Armor: 2

Movement: Short

Modifications: Social engineering, persuasion, intimidation, and lying as level 6

Combat: Many aristocrats have had training in combat maneuvers, as is appropriate to their station. Others may wield knives, scalpels, or butcher’s tools with precision.

Interaction: Interaction with an aristocrat often starts out positive—after all, it is delightful to be in the glow of someone so charming and powerful. For some, the interaction remains positive. A knight is just a knight. For others, a sense of unease begins to settle in after a time, as if there’s something not quite right behind the facade.

Use: An aristocrat is about to marry and someone is worried about the safety of their future spouse. A knight is outmatched by a dragon or other strong opponent and seeks someone to come to their aid.

Loot: Most aristocrats have currency equal to a very expensive item, in addition to fine clothes or medium armor, weapons, and miscellaneous items.

GM intrusions: The aristocrat’s house has a sentient door or lock that suddenly begins to yell about intruders.

Child 1 (3)

Children play the roles of urchins, siblings, daughters, sons, waifs, servants, royal family members, child brides, and more.

Motive: Seeking safety, comfort, money, or food; play; bringing joy

Environment: With their families, or lost in the world trying to find their way. Sometimes in

the employ or care of someone who has found them, stolen them, or otherwise become

their guardians, caretakers, or keepers. 

Health: 3

Damage Inflicted: 1 point

Movement: Short

Modifications: Run, hide, sneak, and escape as level 2; knowledge of the nearby area, people, and activities as level 3

Combat: Most children fight only in response to being provoked, threatened, or attacked. They typically use makeshift weapons, such as their fists, a stick, or a toy. 

Interaction: Children are often smarter, more creative, and more wily than they’re given credit for. They may have a lot of knowledge about nearby people, places, and activities that can help the PCs, particularly if there’s an exchange of food, money, or other goodies involved.

Use: Someone or something is stealing children from the village, and the mayor is offering to pay a large sum to anyone who tracks down the creature and rescues the children. One of the PCs catches a waif stealing from their pack in the night; the child says they’ve been lost in the woods for days.

Loot: Children typically have very little on their person, although they may have a special memento of their family or a close friend.

GM intrusions: The child shouts, laughs, or talks too loudly, accidentally drawing the attention of a nearby guard toward a character.

Someone mistakenly thinks a character has stolen the child, and attacks them.

Crafter 2 (6)

Crafters include bakers, cobblers, candlemakers, butchers, millers, tailors, woodworkers, and cooks. While most crafters aren’t particularly agile fighters, they are usually clever and strong, and have a number of familiar tools at their disposal for weapons.

Motive: Defense

Environment: In their workshops or peddling their trade while traveling 

Health: 8

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Appropriate craft as level 3

Combat: Crafters are unlikely to initiate combat, as most just want to be left alone to do

their work (or to convince you to buy their wares). If they’re forced to fight, they will typically use any item they have at hand (such as a rolling pin, butcher’s knife, crafting tool, or length of wood).

Interaction: Most crafters are happy to talk about their craft or the objects that they’ve made and have for sale. They take pride in their work, and flattery and attention can go a long way.

Use: To the PCs, crafters can be allies, obstacles, or both. Being friends with a crafter often has obvious long-term benefits, while stealing from them has short-term advantages (and possible long-term disadvantages).

Loot: A crafter has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, as well as crafting tools and materials and anything they’ve crafted that they’re carrying or wearing.

GM intrusion: The crafter uses their crafting tool in a way that the character didn’t anticipate, putting the character in a disadvantaged position.

Huntsman/Woodcutter 2 (6)

A huntsman may be in the employ of a powerful magic user, protecting a section of the woods they consider their own, or just trying to provide for their family by chopping wood and hunting game.

Motive: Follow orders, support their loved ones, protect the innocent

Environment: Woods, forests, and other wild lands 

Health: 8

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Tracking and pathfinding as level 4

Combat: Huntsmen and woodcutters both understand the power of the perfectly aimed

shot or swing. They take their time, steady their hand and breath, and hit with precision

and force.

When they take no action on a turn, their next attack inflicts twice the normal damage. Interaction: Many huntsmen and woodcutters are motivated by a deep need to be loyal,

but they’re also soft of heart and have a strong moral center. If they’re tasked with

something they deem unpalatable, they may forgo their promises and go rogue.

Use: They are hunting the characters on the orders of a higher authority. They save the PCs

from a dangerous foe, then ask for assistance for their own tasks.

Loot: In addition to their clothing and mundane weapon, they likely have an expensive

token of promise or affection from someone they have helped or who they owe fealty to.

GM intrusion: A perfectly timed cut sends a tree down in the direction of the character.

Robber/Thief 4 (12)

Robbers, thieves, highwaymen, robin hoods—whatever name you call them, they want what you have, and they’re willing to get it any way they can. Some robbers are honorable, stealing only from the rich or the evil. Others will take anything that isn’t nailed down or magically protected.

Robbers often travel in pairs or small groups of dedicated friends and fellow robbers. Motive: What’s yours is mine

Environment: Anywhere there’s something to be stolen

Health: 12

Damage Inflicted: 2 points

Armor: 1

Movement: Short

Modifications: Stealth, including sneaking, stealing, hiding, and deception, as level 5; attacking from hiding as level 5

Combat: Robbers typically prefer light and medium weapons, particularly bows and small blades. Interaction: Most robbers have a moral code of some sort—it just may not be the code

that others abide by. Still, they are willing to listen to reason (and particularly the sound of sliding coins). Robbers are often willing to be hired for jobs that are too difficult for others.

Use: Robbers happen upon the place where the characters have made camp, and ask to join them. A group of robbers arrives to steal a thing that the characters are just about to steal themselves.

Loot: Depending on whether they’ve just robbed someone or not, robbers may have anywhere from nothing (other than their weapons and clothing) up to the currency equivalent of a very expensive item.

GM intrusion: The robber’s arrow manages to hit two foes in a single attack, or the robber shoots two arrows at multiple foes.

Scholar 2 (6)

Scholars might be librarians, sages, wise women, crones, experts, or soothsayers. Typically, scholars seek knowledge above all else, and many also are willing to share it with others (sometimes for a price, sometimes just for the joy of sharing knowledge). A scholar’s expertise might be general or specific—they may study the world at large or home in on a specific type of magic or fey being, for example.

Motive: Find answers, seek knowledge

Environment: Schools, libraries, the royal study, laboratories, and anywhere there are sources of information 

Health: 6

Damage Inflicted: 3 points

Movement: Short

Modifications: Intuition, persuasion, detecting falsehoods, and most knowledge tasks as level 4

Combat: Scholars prefer to avoid a fight. If they must fight, a scholar tries to deduce a foe’s

weaknesses (if any) and exploit them in combat. Some scholars might have learned spells or abilities from those they’ve studied. Others might be examining a useful cypher or artifact, and will use it on their attackers.

Interaction: Most scholars are helpful and full of information (whether or not it’s useful or true information varies from scholar to scholar). What they don’t know, they may be willing to learn or study, if given the proper tools and incentive. However, some scholars are secretive, hoarding their knowledge for their own personal uses.

Use: Scholars can be incredible allies, offering clues, hints, and information that can help the characters. However, they may be reclusive and hard to find, hidden away in ancient libraries or secret laboratories.

Loot: Most scholars have currency equivalent to a very expensive item and one or two cyphers.

GM Intrusion: Something the scholar is studying comes alive, creating havoc and disarray throughout the area.

## CYPHERS

## MODERN MAGIC CYPHERS

The Cypher System Rulebook assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but depending on the nature of magic in the modern fantasy setting, some or all cyphers might be physical objects (manifest cyphers) with magical powers. This immediately creates a different gameplay dynamic than a game that uses only subtle cyphers. First, it means that the PCs can exchange cyphers with each other, allowing them better optimizations of their abilities and counteracting their weaknesses. Second, it means their cyphers can be stolen from them, forcing them to adapt to a situation without their extra magical tricks. Third, it probably means that fantastic cyphers become the norm because magic easily allows for fantastic effects.

Manifest Cypher Forms

The form a manifest cypher takes— such as a potion or scroll—doesn’t affect its abilities at all. A potion that eases the user’s next task by three steps is functionally identical to a magical scroll that does the same thing. The only difference is the look and feel (campaign flavor) in the story.

## APPS AS CYPHERS

Apps are a great cypher option for modern, urban settings. The character will need a working device, such as a cell phone or a cloud storage artifact, to buy, download, or otherwise gain apps. However, in most cases the device doesn’t need to be working to activate the app. Draining the device’s battery or turning it off doesn’t affect the app or someone’s ability to use it. (Breaking the device, losing it, or having it stolen might be another matter.)

Because each app is a unique magical item (meaning only one exists in the world, unlike a regular app, which can be downloaded by everyone who wants it), they’re harder to find than regular apps. Instead, you likely need to purchase one directly from the person who created it. Some campaign settings might have physical app stores, while others might require clandestine trades, electronic thievery, or some other means of securing the app. In other settings, an app might be something you download into a modified body part or integrated piece of hardware.

Absolute Power

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: App, battery, bone

Effect: Powers a single device for a day. The device can be as simple as a cell phone or as complex as a jet airplane, as long as the device’s power requirement is equal to or less than the cypher level. In general, something like a cell phone is a level 1 power requirement, a boat engine is a level 5 power requirement, and a jet airplane is a level 10 power requirement.

Algomancy

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: App, bookmark, tarot card

Effect: Allows the user to take anything driven by an algorithm (such as video and music services, social media, search engines, and so on) and use it to divine the future. If the user spends one roundstudying the algorithm, then for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, they gain limited precognition and can predict what’s going to happen next. They gain an asset on initiative tasks and all defense rolls. In addition, they can warn their friends of what’s coming, and ease their friends’ next action.

Ambiance

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Key fob, feather, DVD

Effect: Allows you to control the lights, sound, and other atmospheric elements within any space that you are in for ten minutes per cypher level. This includes adjusting non-adjustable lights, lighting or blowing out candles, soundproofing, starting or stopping music through any available medium, starting a fire, and so on.

Anywhere Web

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Spiderweb, key fob, key

Effect: Allows you to access and interact with the internet from anywhere, without needing any type of physical device, including a phone, keyboard, or screen. You can see the internet as if there were a screen in front of you, type as if there were a keyboard, hear as if there were speakers, and speak as if into a microphone. Others you choose within immediate range can also see and hear what you are seeing and hearing (but cannot interact with it). This works even in places where there is no internet connectivity and lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Below the Law

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: App, temporary tattoo, patch

Effect: Once activated, the cypher makes it difficult for any member of the law or people in a position of power to perceive, apprehend, or punish you. This includes police, guards, the mayor, mob bosses, regular bosses, and so on. All tasks involving illegal or unsanctioned activities are eased, including stealing, sneaking, getting away, escaping bonds, and so on. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Best Gift

Level: 1d6

Form: Granny square, key, candle

Effect: The user picks someone they know, and the cypher transforms into a beautifully wrapped box that person can hold in their hand. Inside the box is a small, thoughtful gift (whose value does not exceed a moderately priced item) that the recipient will truly love.

Beverage Bestie

Level: 1d6

Form: App, mug, charm

Effect: The user picks someone they know, and that person will have their favorite morning beverage delivered to them at their bedside at the exact moment they are ready for it. The user doesn’t need to know their chosen person’s favorite beverage, their location, or when they will wish for it—the magic takes care of it.

Borrowed Familiar

Level: 1d6

Form: Feather, cat’s whisker, figurine of a dog

Effect: Activating the cypher creates a living version of the creature it represented. This creature is actually the clone of another magic user’s familiar that was stored in the object. For the next day per cypher level, the creature becomes the user’s temporary familiar, providing an asset to all magic-related actions (including defense actions). The creature cannot be harmed, but at the end of its time, it fades away.

Brain Overclock

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: App, mushroom, hair clip

Effect: Amplifies the user’s mental abilities so their senses are keener and their brain works far beyond its normal capacity.

Roll for effect:

| D6  | Effect                                                        |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Increases Intellect Edge by 1 for one hour                    |
| 2   | Trained in Intellect Defense for one hour                     |
| 3   | Add +1 damage to all Intellect-based attacks for one hour     |
| 4   | Eases all Intellect-based attacks for one hour                |
| 5   | Restores Intellect Pool to full                               |
| 6   | Become trained in two noncombat Intellect skills for one hour |

Burn Your Bridges

Level: 1d6

Form: App, candle, bones

Effect: Covers and destroys the user’s trail in such a way that it makes them very hard to follow. This might include covering their scent, destroying ladders or bridges, creating face-recognition distortion, blurring their license plate, or establishing a false trail. Anyone attempting to follow or track them for one day per cypher level finds their actions hindered by two steps.

Burner Phone

Level: 1d6

Form: Key fob, charm, hair clip

Effect: Creates or transforms into a basic mobile phone that can make and receive telephone calls and text messages like a prepaid phone. Calls and texts made from this phone appear as “UNKNOWN CALLER” with the number obscured; once contacted, the recipient can call or text this phone like any other phone. The phone uses normal (prepaid) cellular connections, but has no internet access or other functions other than sending and receiving calls and texts.

The phone lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which it becomes inert, nonfunctional, and untrackable (like a mobile phone that has been broken and its chip removed). The user of the cypher can end it early as an action by speaking a command word or physically breaking it.

Cloak of the Crafter

Level: 1d6

Form: Oil, moss, granny square

Effect: When activated, it cloaks the user in what looks like a handmade wrap, such as a shawl, scarf, or cloak, for an hour per cypher level. During that time, the user’s crafting-related tasks are eased, and everything they craft is one level higher than it normally would be. In addition, the user can find up to two ingredients they need (up to the level of the cypher) in the pockets of the cloak.

Dancing on Air

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Feather, bullet, charm

Effect: The user is lifted a foot (30 cm) or so off the ground, as if there is a pocket of air between them and whatever surface is below them. They can move normally as if walking across a smooth, flat surface. This works even if the substance below them would not normally hold them, such as water or thin ice. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Dumpster Fire

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Matchbook, coaster, rope

Effect: Instantly transforms to become a large, contained fire that creates a deep feeling of gloom and despair in all creatures chosen by the user within long range of it who fail an Intellect defense roll. Any negative actions the user takes against those creatures (including combat) are eased by one step, and any positive actions they take for those creatures (such as attempting to inspire them) are hindered by one step.

Duplicity Window

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Sticker, flyer, stamp

Effect: When this cypher is stuck on any window or other transparent item, the user can alter what can be seen from the other side. While this illusion might be used in a simple way, such as creating a blackout window on a car, it could also be much more complex, such as creating an elaborate dance party inside an otherwise empty apartment. The illusion level is equal to the cypher level and fools the vision of living creatures as well as that of magical and electronic eyes. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Exceptional Engine

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Herbs, battery, flip lighter

Effect: When activated near an engine, computer, device, program, or piece of machinery, the affected target works exceptionally well for the next ten minutes per cypher level, easing all tasks involved with operating it. For example, a car handles better, a hacking program works faster, an elevator door closes before a pursuer can get on, and so on.

Extrovert Shield

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Carved figure, bones, building blocks

Effect: Creates the semblance of a being of the user’s choice, such as a human who walks beside them, a bird that sits on their shoulders, or a robot, to act as their shield in social situations. The first time they would take damage from a mental attack, the being absorbs that damage (up to the cypher level) and reflects it back onto the attacker; the user makes an Intellect-based attack roll for this reflected damage. After that, the being disappears.

Fade to Black

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Mirror, lapel pin, spiderweb

Effect: Turns the user into a shadow for ten minutes per cypher level. During that time, the user looks exactly like their own shadow, is two-dimensional, and can move through any space where light could shine through. As a shadow, the user can make magical attacks but not physical ones. They take no physical damage. However, any successful magical attacks against them inflict +1 point of damage.

Faraday Ward

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: App, pocket handkerchief, lapel pin

Effect: When activated, the ward protects the user, their items, and their devices from any attempts at scrying, electromagnetic surveillance, and similar observation whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s for ten minutes per cypher level.

Fey Collar

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Collar, knitted scarf, necklace

Effect: When placed around a creature’s neck, the collar locks and prevents the wearer from using magic of any kind (up to the level of the cypher). If the creature is a PC, each time they try to use magic they must succeed at an Intellect-based roll against the cypher level; otherwise that attempt is blocked. The collar lasts for ten minutes per cypher level and then disintegrates.

Ghost Tag

Level: 1d6

Form: Spray paint, feather, lipstick

Effect: Allows the user to leave their tag on someone else’s graffiti, painting, or public artwork. The tag includes a spoken message up to twenty words long and is invisible except to the creature the user designates. That creature can touch the tag and hear the entirety of the message.

Girl Moss

Level: 1d6

Form: Mushroom, chalk, seed packet

Effect: The user melds into whatever soft thing is near them, such as moss, earth, or a blanket, and becomes nearly indistinguishable from that thing. For a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, they gain an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected (even by magic). Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in any way breaks the effect.

Got Your Back

Level: 1d6

Form: Napkin, straw, coaster

Effect: The cypher turns bright blue in the presence of any type of drug, poison, or other detrimental or dangerous substance whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level. The effect lasts for one day.

Gravity Denied

Level: 1d6

Form: App, feather, balloon

Effect: The user no longer has to follow gravity’s laws. For one minute per cypher level, they can walk (or crawl or run) on steep inclines and horizontal surfaces (such as walls and cliffs) as if they were on flat ground. When using this ability, “down” for them is either the surface they are walking on or the normal orientation of gravity (their choice).

Great Hair Day

Level: 1d6

Form: Hair clip, twigs, bones

Effect: When activated, the cypher makes the user’s hair look like it did on their best hair day ever. For the next 24 hours, they have an asset in all confidence-based actions, social and otherwise.

Growwell

Level: 1d6

Form: Herbs, seed packet, bouquet of flowers

Effect: Causes a garden to sprout in any immediate area. The garden is self-sustaining and doesn’t need soil, sun, or water. It includes flowers, vegetables, and herbs, and lasts for a number of months equal to the cypher level.

Handwave

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Fingerless glove, ring, temporary tattoo

Effect: When the user places this cypher upon their hand as an action, they can take three actions on their next turn.

Hashtag

Level: 1d6

Form: App, flyer, electronic stylus

Effect: The user chooses a word or short phrase when activating this cypher. For an hour per cypher level, that word will glow when they encounter it in their environment in a way that only they can perceive, allowing them to pick it out from its surroundings easily. This glow will appear around the word itself as well as symbols and objects. For example, if they choose “apple,” they will sense a glow around the word in print, around an actual apple, and around the symbol of an apple logo on a computer. This doesn’t extend their range of vision farther than they can normally see.

This cypher adjusts to be beneficial to the user. For example, if a non-sighted character uses hashtag, the cypher might create a sound or sensation around the chosen word rather than a glow, or the glow might be visible in their mind’s eye instead.

Here All Along

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: App, needle and thread, ID card

Effect: Allows the user to instantly create a long trail on the internet for someone that they just made up. This includes social media accounts, a personal or business website, photos and videos, friends, and so on. The information stays on the internet forever.

Instant Automobile

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Key, charm, temporary tattoo

Effect: Creates or transforms into a large automobile that can carry up to eight people. The user or other characters must steer the automobile as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the automobile grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the automobile can move a short distance each round under its own power. The automobile lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.

> The vehicle created by an instant automobile cypher is utilitarian and unremarkable rather than flashy, more like a station wagon, generic van, panel truck, or SUV. In some settings, local laws might require these temporary magical vehicles to have a specific color or text to easily identify them as such, including a unique license plate that can be tracked like any registered vehicle. Likewise, an instant motorcycle cypher creates a functional but not particularly “sexy” motorbike.

Instant Delivery

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: App, feather, stamp

Effect: Allows the user to have a letter, small package, or any object up to about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) delivered almost instantaneously to someone. If the object is dangerous, such as a bomb, the recipient’s level must be equal to or less than the cypher’s. The user must know the person’s name and at least one small fact about them, but doesn’t need to know their location. Within a round of having left the user, the package will arrive within a short distance of the recipient.

Instant Motorcycle

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Playing card, key, metal flask

Effect: Creates or transforms into a motorcycle that can comfortably carry one person (or two people sitting tandem). The user or other characters must steer the motorcycle as normal. At cypher level 4 and higher, the motorcycle grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the motorcycle can move a short distance each round under its own power. The motorcycle lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.

Lie To Me

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Contact lenses, goggles, mask

Effect: Once activated and worn, allows the user to see through all deceptions, mirages, and illusions (up to the level of the cypher) for a day. Also provides the user with an asset on lying, cheating, illusions, and other deception tasks.

Light ‘Em Up

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Laser light pointer, pair of glasses, key fob

Effect: Activating the cypher causes a powerful beam of magic light to erupt from the user’s body part they choose. The beam stretches a short range and inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. It affects even creatures (such as ghosts and vampires) that normally can’t be harmed by mundane weapons. Once activated, the weapon is active for ten minutes.

Lucky Charm

Level: 1d6

Form: Worry stone, fuzzy dice, deck of cards

Effect: Rubbing the lucky charm draws a tiny bit of luck away from someone else and gives it to the user, causing something to happen that makes the user’s next action a little easier. This might be a friend showing up, a tool appearing just where the user needs it, or the traffic lights changing to green just as the user arrives. Effectively, using this cypher grants the player a player intrusion without having to spend 1 XP.

Magic Aura Tracker

Level: 1d6

Form: App, bus ticket, 3D glasses

Effect: User can view the cypher’s symbols to see if the ambient power of magic in the area is normal, high (increased capabilities or prone to disruptive surges), low (decreased effects or scarcity), or absent. It can also be configured to display power levels for individual kinds of magic (fire, necromancy, illusion) separately from the standard readings. This lasts for five hours per cypher level.

Mental Load Alleviator

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Worry stone, pen, figurine

Effect: Helps take on some of the user’s mental loads for the next day, including creating shopping lists, organizing the calendar, project management, working on spells, and decision making. During this time, the user gains +1 to their Intellect Edge and +5 to their Intellect Pool (+7 to their Intellect Pool if the cypher is level 9 or higher).

Merciful Memory

Level: 1d6

Form: Candle, charm, 3D glasses

Effect: For one willing target (including the user), the user can alter a negative memory into one that’s mor positive. Altering the memory takes a few rounds, depending on the intricacy and difficulty of the memory. Once the memory is altered, it remains that way for a day. During that time, the target gains +5 to their Intellect Pool and all tasks involving the memory (such as talking to the person the memory’s about) are eased.

Next You

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Comb, mirror, hair pin

Effect: Activating the cypher brings up a magical avatar of the user. The user can alter all parts of their avatar, include hair color and style, clothing, jewelry, makeup, gender, height, and so on. After one round, the changes they’ve made to the avatar are made to their own body. The effect lasts for one hour per cypher level.

No Take Backs

Level: 1d6

Form: Temporary tattoo, playing card, skein of yarn

Effect: Activating the cypher creates an invisible bubble around the user. The next time a foe inflicts damage on the user, the bubble registers the type of attack (such as melee, magic, or ranged) and alters itself to protect the user from the next attack of that type. When the user would next take damage from the same type of attack, the bubble absorbs all of it and then pops.

Pickpocket

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: App, stone, key fob

Effect: The next time the user attempts to pickpocket someone, they automatically succeed against a target whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s, and they gain an asset to their task against targets whose level is higher than the cypher’s. In addition to the items the target has in their pocket, the user gains a random cypher (of a level equal to or less than the level of the pickpocket cypher).

Pocket Protector

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Metal flask, flip lighter, book

Effect: If the user is shot with a bullet, arrow, or other projectile, the cypher just happens to be in the right place to protect them from all damage. Unlike a standard cypher, this protective effect occurs without the user’s action to activate it. Once used to protect against one attack chosen by the user, the cypher turns to dust.

Portal Stone

Level: 1d6

Form: Stone, marble, baseball

Effect: Placing an object beneath the portal stone and letting it rest there for one round shifts it to an undiscoverable location, such as another dimension or world (depending on the setting). The item can only be retrieved by holding the portal stone and whispering the name of the object.

Power Device

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: App, flip lighter, seed packet

Effect: Magically powers one device that can fit within an area a short distance across. The device is now fully powered, charged, or fueled. If the cypher is used on an automobile, for example, the gas tank is full. If used on a flashlight, the battery is fully charged.

Power House

Level: 1d6

Form: Stone, wood, building box

Effect: Expands into an instant tiny home complete with a washroom, sleeping area, and kitchen space. The entirety of the structure is about 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet (6 m by 6 m by 3.5 m). It lasts for 24 hours, at which point it and all nonliving things inside it disintegrate.

Presto Change-O

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Skein of yarn, key fob, key

Effect: Allows the user to alter the appearance of a single vehicle whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level for the next day. This could be a minor alteration, such as changing the paint color and the license plate number, or it could be a major one, such as changing a horse-drawn carriage into a go-kart. The new vehicle must be able to traverse the same type of terrain as the original (the user can change a canoe into a speedboat, for example, but not into a plane or a race car).

Puzzle Box

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Building block, flip lighter, locket

Effect: Allows the user to put a creature (up to the level of the cypher) inside an item the user touches with the cypher. The creature shrinks to fit inside the item. While inside the item, the creature is in stasis and cannot take any actions. They cannot be harmed in any way and they do not experience time moving forward. The creature stays inside permanently, unless they are released by magic or until the user chooses to let them out.

Quick Pic

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: App, pen, stone with a hole in it

Effect: Allows the user to snap a quick image of whatever they point it at. The image stays perfectly in their mind for the next 24 hours. By touching an appropriate device, they can download the image, print it out, or digitally alter it. At the end of 24 hours, all versions of the image, including the one in their head, disappear.

Quick Pickup

Level: 1d6

Form: App, key, fidget toy

Effect: For a number of hours equal to the cypher level, anytime the user needs a ride somewhere, one instantly appears. This could be a rideshare, a city bike, a horse, a canoe, a friend with a car, a helicopter, or something else, as the GM determines.

Real Fake

Level: 1d6

Form: App, playing card, ticket

Effect: When placed against any form of ID, such as a driver’s license, birth certificate, or passport, the cypher instantly transforms into a perfect copy of that ID, including photos, watermarks, and any other identifying or verifying features. The duplicate lasts for a number of days equal to the cypher level.

Repair Module

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Remote control, bullet, needle and thread

Effect: Repairs a single device or machine of any kind (up to the level of the cypher) once. This could work on an artifact, a computer, a piece of lab equipment, a mechanical cider press, a furnace, and so on. The user doesn’t need any knowledge of the machine or what’s wrong with it, but they must be able to touch the machine and continue to do so for the length of the repair. The repair takes one minute per level of the machine.

Safe Space

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: App, knitted scarf, letter

Effect: Allows the user to create a temporary safe space around them that takes the form of their choosing, such as a bed, bathroom, mossy grove, and so on. The place looks, sounds, and feels just as the user imagines it. During that time, no one and nothing outside the space can see, hear, or interact with the user in any way, nor can they see, hear, or interact with anything outside their safe space. While in their safe space, they restore a number

of points equal to the cypher level, distributing them as they see fit among their Pools. When they return, it’s as though they never went away and no time has passed. They can remain in the space for up to one hour per cypher level.

Screen Control

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: App, mirror, granny square

Effect: A technological screen (a television, computer monitor, smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.

Social Battery

Level: 1d6

Form: Battery, doll, feather

Effect: Allows you to recharge your social battery, providing you with an asset on all positive social interactions, including persuasion, charm, flirtation, and succor. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Soul Saver

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Egg, battery, cross-stitch square

Effect: Brings a dead creature whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s back to life for ten minutes per cypher level. PCs are automatically brought back for the duration. The creature is exactly as they were in life, with the same stats, personality, knowledge, and so on, but only has 2 points of health or Might. If the creature’s health or Might Pool is healed to full in some way during this time, they return to life permanently, but with a 3-point reduction in their maximum health or Might Pool.

Stay Down

Level: 1d6

Form: Nail polish, glove, stick

Effect: Upon activating the cypher, the user’s hand crackles with power and noise. They emit a concussive blast at a single foe within long range, inflicting 3 points of damage, knocking them prone, and stunning them for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.

Take Me There

Level: 1d6

Form: Crayon, chalk, lipstick

Effect: The user spends a few rounds drawing a map of somewhere they’re trying to get to. Even if the map is not the least bit accurate, they will sense a thread of magic leading them to their desired destination. If the place they seek is hidden, they must make an Intellect roll against its level to see if they succeed (the cypher provides an asset). The thread lasts for one day per cypher level or until they reach their destination, whichever is sooner.

Talk to Me

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Spiderweb, flyer, building blocks

Effect: The user can talk to any creature that is part of a structure, such as a mermaid in a fountain statue, a stone gargoyle on a skyscraper, or a dragon-shaped doorbell on a private home. The user can ask them a number of questions equal to the cypher level and get true answers. The questions must pertain to something the creature would know, such as something they saw or heard in the area, something they felt, or who made them.

Teleportation Block

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Bird’s nest, remote control, building block

Effect: A short area within immediate range of the user becomes warded against any teleportation effect or other ability that allows travel without direct physical movement (including abilities specifically meant to get around obstacles, such as Bypass Barrier). Any creature whose level is less than the cypher level can’t use these methods to get in or out. Player characters using such abilities must succeed at an Intellect-based task with a difficulty equal to the cypher level in order to enter or leave the area. The block lasts for one day per cypher level.

Through the Window

Level: 1d6

Form: App, mirror, flyer

Effect: The user chooses any window they can see, and they are able to look through it as if they were standing right in front of it. The window does not need to be transparent, the user does not need to stay in sight of the window after they choose it, and no one else can perceive what they’re doing. While they are looking through the window, they can wink to change their vision back to their current location, then wink again to return to the window. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level or until they choose to end it.

Time Ticket

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Bus ticket, moss, remote control

Effect: For the next day, no matter what time the user leaves or what hurdles they encounter, they will arrive exactly on time for the event, ride, or other activity. Busses and planes will not leave without them, the play or movie will not start until they arrive, and they’ll meet people exactly when they said they would. (Note that this doesn’t change how the user gets there— they may still sit in traffic forever or get stuck in the security line.) Their traveling companions, if any, enjoy the same benefit as long as they stick with the user.

Tunnel Traverser

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Coveralls, poncho, knitted scarf

Effect: When activated, it turns the wearer into a liquid or gaseous form of themselves, allowing them to travel through small spaces, such as air ducts, sewer tunnels, tight caverns, and so on. Efforts to detect the user are hindered by two steps (or three steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher), even by magic or security systems. The spaces must be at least 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter and must not be blocked by rocks, doors, and so on. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

What the Doctor Ordered

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Potion, herbs, candle

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the user’s choice of Pools. In addition, the user adds +3 to their next recovery roll.

Who’s Looking

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Remote control, glass eye, stone with a hole

Effect: For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the cypher vibrates any time the user is being monitored, watched, or tracked by something of the cypher level or less. This includes people, devices, security systems, cameras, spells, and so on.

Wire Wraith

Level: 1d6

Form: Wire, broken electronics, phone charger

Effect: Activating the cypher creates a large wraithlike being that looks as if it’s formed from wire. The wraith is a level 4 incorporeal construct that inflicts 4 points of electrical damage (ignores Armor) with its touch when directed. While the construct persists, the user can use it to slip through small areas, carry an electrical current, or attack foes. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.

Wrecking Balls

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Baseball, bouncy ball, marble

Effect: When thrown, the ball multiplies into a number of itself equal to the cypher level. Each ball bounces once and then slams into targets within long range chosen by the user. The impact of each ball does 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). If the same foe is hit by two or more balls, they are also knocked prone for one round.

You’re Safe Now

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Suspenders, lapel pin, spiderweb

Effect: Once the user activates the cypher, it protects them from ambient damage. The next time they would take ambient damage, such as from falling off a roof or being electrocuted by a power line, the cypher absorbs all of the damage (up to the cypher level).

Software Cyphers

EasyMagic.App

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: App

Effect: Adds +1 to the user’s Intellect Edge (+2 for cypher level 5 or higher) for the next 24 hours, but only for the purpose of casting spells.

When the cypher is activated, the user attracts the attention of a malevolent internet d@emon, who slides into their internet-connected devices and starts draining their magic. The d@emon remains even after the cypher’s duration expires.

Malware Cyphers

EasyMagic.app has a beneficial effect, but also a serious drawback—it attracts a hostile creature to prey upon the user’s magic. The cypher is significantly better than a typical Edge-augmenting cypher like an Intellect booster (lasting 24 hours instead of one hour) in order to trick a naive or greedy character into activating it. Magicians well-versed in cypher lore (and human nature) recognize that this sort of thing is too good to be true.

The GM should feel free to create similar kinds of malware app cyphers that are somewhat better than the standard ones in this chapter or in the Cypher System Rulebook, and give them a harmful side effect. Example malware cypher benefits are curatives that add more points or affect two Pools at once, Effort enhancers that can be used two or more times in an hour, and perfections that don’t require an action to activate (and therefore can affect a roll on the same turn the user activates the cypher).

Example malware cypher drawbacks are hindering the user’s attack spells, debiting the user’s bank account, monitoring the user’s in-person or magical communications, deleting the user’s other magical app cyphers, compelling the user to take a specific action, “locking” one of the user’s spells until they pay a ransom, accessing private data such as passwords or photos, and so on.

Other common malware cypher names are WarlockAntivirus, SpellManager, HexCleaner, TomeBot, and ScryBlocker.

## SUPERHERO CYPHERS

POWER BOOST CYPHERS 

This section introduces two new power boost cyphers, and consolidates the two efficacy boost cyphers in the Cypher System Rulebook into one cypher with variable effects based on cypher level.

| 01-10 | Area boost     |
|-------|----------------|
| 11-20 | Burst boost    |
| 21-30 | Damage boost   |
| 31-40 | Efficacy boost |
| 41-50 | Energy boost   |
| 51-60 | Range boost    |
| 61-80 | Shift boost    |
| 81-90 | Stunt boost    |
| 91-00 | Target boost   |

## EFFICACY BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: This cypher boosts an ability that requires a skill roll. The use of the ability is eased (eased by two steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher).

## SHIFT BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher boosts one power shift

that the user already has, granting them an additional power shift in that category that lasts for one round. For example, if the user has a shift in resilience, they can use this cypher to gain an additional shift in resilience for one round. If the user has more than one kind of power shift (such as dexterity and strength), they choose which kind of power shift to boost.

## STUNT BOOST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: This cypher eases the user’s next difficult, formidable, or impossible power stunt task by four steps (eased by five steps if the cypher is level 7 or higher). It has no effect on power stunts that don’t require a successful power stunt task.

## FANTASY CYPHERS

Magic items are a staple of fantasy stories and games. In the Cypher System, these magic items are, of course, cyphers. The Cypher System assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but in a fantasy game the assumption is usually the opposite—cyphers are physical objects (manifest cyphers) with magical powers, which the heroes find as treasure, gifts, or rewards for their adventures and exploits. 

## MIXING SUBTLE AND MANIFEST CYPHERS  
There’s no reason why a fantasy campaign can’t use manifest cyphers and subtle cyphers. In this setup, manifest cyphers are the tangible objects found in treasure hoards, and subtle cyphers represent good fortune, the blessings of the gods, and other coincidences that benefit the characters. 

## CYPHER FORMS

What form a manifest cypher takes— such as a potion or scroll—doesn’t affect its abilities at all. A potion that eases the user’s next task by three steps is functionally identical to a magical scroll that does the same thing.

To randomly determine a manifest cypher’s form, roll on the following table.

| d100  | Cypher Form        |
|-------|--------------------|
| 01-02 | Bone runeplate     |
| 03-04 | Book page          |
| 05-07 | Bottle of powder   |
| 08-09 | Brand              |
| 10-12 | Brick              |
| 13-15 | Carved bone        |
| 16-18 | Carved stick       |
| 19-20 | Carved tooth       |
| 21-23 | Chalky potion      |
| 30-33 | Clay runeplate     |
| 34-37 | Crystal            |
| 38-39 | Elaborate scar     |
| 40-42 | Envelope of powder |
| 43-44 | Fuming potion      |
| 45-47 | Glass              |
| 48-50 | Leaf               |
| 51-54 | Leather scroll     |
| 55-57 | Metal runeplate    |
| 58-60 | Oily potion        |
| 61-62 | Paper scroll       |
| 63-66 | Papyrus scroll     |
| 67-71 | Parchment scroll   |
| 72-74 | Pouch of powder    |
| 75-76 | Skin drawing       |
| 77-80 | Stone              |
| 81-82 | Tattoo             |
| 83-85 | Thick potion       |
| 86-88 | Tube of power      |
| 89-92 | Vellum scroll      |
| 93-96 | Watery potion      |
| 97-00 | Wood runeplate     |

## EXAMPLE FANTASY CYPHERS

All of the cyphers in this chapter are manifest and fantastic cyphers.

## FANTASY CYPHERS TABLE

| 01-05 | Acid resistance        |
|-------|------------------------|
| 06-11 | Animal control         |

## ACID RESISTANCE

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against acid damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour. 

ANIMAL CONTROL 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on an Intellect attack against a beast whose level does not exceed the cypher’s level. If successful, the beast immediately becomes calm. The beast awaits the user’s commands and carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level minus the target’s level. (If the result is 0, the target is enslaved for only one minute.) The beast could attack or defend, a dog could follow a scent or retrieve an object, a badger could dig a hole, and so on. 

The cypher doesn’t give the user any special ability to understand the target or perceive through its senses. For example, the user can command an eagle to fly above a group of enemies, but the eagle can’t describe what it sees and the user can’t look through its eyes. 

“Beast” in this sense refers to creatures of animal-level intelligence and may include unintelligent magical creatures like basilisks, pegasi, and so on.

BEAST SHAPE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: The user transforms into a specific kind of animal, such as a bear, hawk, horse, or wolf (the kind of animal is determined by the cypher’s creator). The user gains the animal’s type of movement (swimming for a fish, flying for a bird, and so on) and two assets on tasks to pretend to be that animal. The user also gains an asset on one skill appropriate to their animal form (or two skills for cypher level 5 and higher). See the Animal Form Minor Abilities table. 

The magic shrinks or enlarges the user to a size more suitable for their animal form, but generally can’t make them more than about 50 percent smaller or larger, so the user might become an unusually large bird or a small bear. This doesn’t affect the animal’s abilities. The user can still use all of their abilities that don’t rely specifically on their normal form. For example, an Adept in wolf form can’t wield a dagger because wolves don’t have hands, but could still use a healing power or mind blast ability. 

After about an hour, the user returns to their normal form.

Depending on the cypher, the user might still be able to speak in a humanoid language, talk in a “language” of animal noises that other transformed people can understand perfectly, speak with animals of the same kind, or none of the above.

COLD RESISTANCE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against cold damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour. 

DEMON WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from demons, devils, and similar malevolent creatures.

DRAGON WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from dragons, wyverns, and similar magical reptilian creatures.

In a typical fantasy campaign, a demon is a supernatural being from another dimension or plane of existence.

ELECTRICITY RESISTANCE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against electricity damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour. 

ELEMENTAL CONJURATION 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: Summons an elemental creature (air, earth, fire, or water) that can understand the verbal commands of the user. Once the elemental is summoned, commanding it is not an action. It can make attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but it cannot speak. The elemental never goes farther than long range away from the user. 

The elemental is not particularly intelligent or capable of initiating action. It responds if attacked, but otherwise does only as commanded. 

The elemental remains for one hour per cypher level or until its physical form is destroyed, after which it vanishes back to its native realm. 

FIRE RESISTANCE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against fire damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

GIANT SIZE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: The user grows to about one and a half times their normal size. While at this larger size, they add 4 points to their Might Pool and +2 to their Might Edge, but their Speed defense rolls are hindered. 

They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends, their Might Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Speed defense, and they subtract 4 points from their Might Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Speed Pool and then, if necessary, from their Intellect Pool). 

If the user is an NPC, the cypher increases their health by 4, eases their Might-based tasks, and hinders their Speed defense. When the effect ends, they lose 4 health and all of the other advantages and penalties from the cypher. 

INSTANT BOAT 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: Creates or transforms into a small sailboat that can carry up to eight people. The user or other characters must row, steer, and sail the boat as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the boat grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the boat can move a short distance each round under its own power. The boat lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.

INSTANT TOWER 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: Creates a simple, squat stone tower with a door, three arrow slits, and a ceiling hatch leading to the roof. The tower is 10 feet (3 m) square and 12 feet (4 m) tall. If the cypher level is 7 or higher, the tower also has a second story (with four arrow slits), increasing its total height to 20 feet (6 m). If there isn’t sufficient room for the tower to reach its full size, it fills the available space, but its appearance and growth does not apply any force or pressure against the confining surfaces. 

The tower is permanent and immobile once created. 

LYCANTHROPE WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from werewolves and other lycanthropes. 

Lycanthrope: Formally, a human who can transform into a wolf. Informally, a human who can transform into an animal, such as a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf

PENULTIMATE KEY 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Effect: Locks or unlocks any one door, portal, chest, or other lockable item of the cypher’s level or lower. The targeted item must have a keyhole for the cypher to work. 

> Legends speak of the Ultimate Key, which can open any lock, even those sealed by a god.

## POISON RESISTANCE

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Effect: The user gains Armor against poison damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

RESTORATIVE AURA 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: Creates an immediate area filled with aromatic smoke, reassuring sounds, gentle light, or other pleasing sensations that last for one hour. Creatures who rest within the area gain +2 on their recovery rolls (or +4 for cypher level 5 and higher). NPCs instead recover 2 health if they spend at least ten minutes within the area (or 4 health for cypher level 5 and higher). For a creature to gain this benefit, its entire rest must occur while the cypher is active. 

THOUGHT LISTENING 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Effect: The user can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range that they can see, even if the target doesn’t want them to. Once the user has established contact, they can read the target’s thoughts for up to one minute per cypher level.

TINY SIZE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: The user shrinks to about one-tenth their normal size. While at this smaller size, they add 4 points to their Speed Pool and +2 to their Speed Edge, but all of their Might actions are hindered by two steps. They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends, their Speed Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Might actions, and they subtract 4 points from their Speed Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Intellect Pool and then, if necessary, from their Might Pool). 

If the user is an NPC, the cypher eases their Speed-based tasks and hinders their Might-based tasks. When the effect ends, they lose all of the advantages and penalties from the cypher. 

UNDEAD WARD 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from skeletons, zombies, ghosts, vampires, and other undead creatures. 

WALKING CORPSE 

Level: 1d6 

Effect: Animates a corpse as a level 1 (or level 2 for cypher level 5 and higher) undead skeleton or zombie, depending on the condition of the body. The corpse can be no larger than a typical human. The animated corpse has none of the intelligence, memories, or special abilities that it had in life. The creature follows the user’s verbal commands for one hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the creature is killed by damage, the user can reanimate it again when its time expires, but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly reanimated state.

## HORROR CYPHERS

Many horror genres feature physical objects that the protagonists can use—alien devices, magical talismans, or mysterious objects with an unknown origin. This chapter describes examples of these objects as cyphers, which can be awarded like other manifest cyphers or in place of subtle cyphers. Unlike those in the Cypher System Rulebook, the manifest cyphers listed here include suggestions for what form the cypher takes (although in a game with magic, any of these cyphers might exist as a potion or spell on a scroll in addition to or instead of the forms listed here).

Most of these are marked as fantastic cyphers, although depending on the genre and circumstances of the game, they might be completely normal.

For your convenience, the cyphers have been organized into lists by horror genre or theme so you can randomly roll for something appropriate to your game without getting one that doesn’t apply (such as a cypher against vampires in an alien invasion horror game). If you’re running a game that mixes several genres, switch between lists each time you need to award a new manifest cypher.

## A SELECTION OF HORROR CYPHERS  
## ANATHEMA SIREN

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Amulet or device

Effect: Creates a strange and annoying noise about the volume of a human shouting. The noise is especially aggravating toward one type of creature; creatures of this type have all their actions hindered by two steps (hindered by three steps if the cypher level is 7 or higher) while within short range of the cypher. The user must use their action each round to manipulate the cypher for the noise and its effects to persist, or it goes silent and loses all power. The siren can be used for up to one minute per cypher level. Roll a d100 to determine what sort of creature is affected:

| 01-10 | Aliens (probably one specific kind of alien) |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 11-16 | Animate dolls and puppets                    |
| 17-22 | Cryptids                                     |
| 23-32 | Demons                                       |
| 33-28 | Doppelgangers                                |
| 39-48 | Ghosts                                       |
| 49-54 | Mummies                                      |
| 55-64 | Robots                                       |
| 65-70 | Simulacra                                    |
| 71-80 | Vampires                                     |
| 81-90 | Werewolves (or some other werecreature)      |
| 91-95 | Extradimensional creatures                   |
| 96-00 | Undead                                       |

## ASCENDANT BRAIN VIVISECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: If used on a beast whose level is less than the cypher level, this enhances connections in the beast’s brain so it attains near-human intelligence and sapience, and gains a basic understanding of one specific language keyed to the cypher. The beast remembers its prior, simpler existence and understands that it has been made smarter. This transformation lasts for one day per cypher level, and then the beast reverts to its normal self slowly over the same number of days, often with violent and erratic outbreaks. For example, if the beast becomes smarter for five days, it loses intelligence gradually over days 6 through 9 and is back to normal on day 10. Additional uses of the cypher tend to have diminishing returns.

When used with an ascendant flesh vivisector, the resulting creature looks, thinks, and acts like a human.

Using this cypher on a beast whose level is too high might end up elevating its intelligence somewhat but also instigating aggressive behavior.

## ASCENDANT FLESH VIVISECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: If used on a beast of no larger than human size whose level is less than the cypher level, this radically alters the beast’s shape so it resembles a human being. The beast-human still thinks and acts like a beast, but it looks like a human and can perform actions using its human dexterity (such as turning a doorknob or walking upright). This transformation lasts for one day

per cypher level, but after an equal amount of time the beast reverts to its normal shape (in the manner described for the ascendant brain vivisector cypher). Additional uses of the cypher tend to have diminishing returns.

Using this cypher on a beast whose level is too high might end up temporarily transforming it into a human with bestial features.

## ORRUPTED CANOPIC JAR

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Jar made of clay or carved stone 

Effect: Breaking open the jar (which destroys the preserved organs inside) permanently grants the user an asset (two assets if the cypher level is 6 or higher) on all attacks and defenses against mummies within short range.

## ECAPITATIVE LONGEVITY

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Injection or potion

Effect: Brings a dead creature’s head (but not the body) back to life for a limited time as an undead creature. The cypher can be used up to an hour before or after death (in anticipation of dying or in response to someone’s death) and requires up to ten minutes to take effect, at which time the creature recovers 1d6 + 6 points to their Pools. Because they are only a head, a PC reanimated this way has a maximum Might and Speed Pool of 3 each. The head has all the mental abilities they had when they were alive (including psychic or telepathic abilities) and can speak, but all their actions are hindered. They have the same appearance as before, except the wounds that killed them are still visible, and in general they have an unnatural look. They do not need to eat, drink, or sleep, but they can still rest if they want to (such as to make a recovery roll). The head remains in this active state for one day per cypher level, after which time it dies again and cannot be reanimated with this cypher.

When using a decapitative longevity cypher to bring a head back to life, it can be left attached to the inert body, or someone can carefully sever the head from the body, which doesn’t harm the head.

## GHOST DETECTOR

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Amulet, crystal, or device 

Effect: Automatically indicates if a ghost, spirit, or similar entity is within a short distance (a long distance if the cypher is level 6 or higher). If the user takes an action to study or focus their attention on the cypher, they can narrow down what quarter-arc of a circle the ghost is

in. If the ghost is normally invisible, it becomes somewhat visible (hindering its stealth attempts by one step). The cypher remains active for ten minutes per cypher level.

## GHOST TRAP

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Crystal or device

Effect: Can be thrown up to a short distance, where it releases a burst of transdimensional energy in an immediate area that absorbs ghosts (including spirits, phased beings, and similar creatures) but does not affect corporeal entities. PCs who meet these criteria must use an Intellect-based action (difficulty equal to the cypher level) to avoid being trapped. NPC ghosts are not affected if their level is higher than the cypher level. The trap holds the ghosts for up to one hour per cypher level, after which they automatically break free (and are probably very angry).

Ghosts in a trap can be permanently stored in a ghost vault. 

## HOMUNCULUS FLASK

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Ornate, opaque alchemical bottle filled with strange fluid

Effect: To activate this cypher, you must open the bottle, add a few fresh drops of your blood (inflicting 1 point of Might damage to you), stopper it again, and leave it alone for one day. When the bottle is next unstoppered, a hand-sized creature called a homunculus crawls out; it vaguely resembles you and serves you for one day per cypher level before dissolving into useless goo. Each time you give it an order, you must make an Intellect defense roll against it; if you fail, it becomes free to ignore your commands (but might pretend to be obedient so it can plot against you).

Homunculus: level 2; alchemy, all defenses, and stealth as level 3

## HORRIFIC ARM

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Injection or pill

Effect: The user’s body rapidly grows a monstrous arm that is approximately the same size as one of their existing limbs. The arm is ugly and malformed, but fully functional.

The user can use this arm as if it were one of their own. The new arm does not grant the user additional actions or attacks in a round, but it can be useful for carrying things. Damage to the arm does not affect the user (the arm can take 6 points of damage directed at it before it becomes nonfunctional). The arm lasts for one day per cypher level.

## HORRIFIC EYE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Injection or spell

Effect: The user’s body rapidly grows a monstrous eye (including a retractable eyestalk if the cypher level is 6 or higher) at the spot where the cypher is applied to their body. The user can see out of this eye as if it were one of their own (including any extraordinary vision-based senses the user normally has). The eye gives the user an asset on vision-based perception rolls, and depending on where it is located, it may allow the user to look around corners surreptitiously. Damage to the eye does not affect the user (the eye can take 1 point of damage directed at it before it becomes nonfunctional). The eye lasts for one day per cypher level.

## HORRIFIC FACE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Injection or pill

Effect: The user rapidly grows a monstrous face (or an entire head if the cypher level is 6 or higher) somewhere on their body. The user can use the senses of this face and talk, breathe, and eat with it (for example, if their normal face is underwater or wrapped in plastic). The face gives the user an asset on perception rolls when its senses can be used—for example, it could hear someone sneaking up on the user, but it couldn’t see them if its eyes were covered, and it can’t help with identifying tastes unless its mouth is also used. Damage to the face does not affect the user (the face can take 3 points of damage directed at it before it becomes nonfunctional). Most people react with disgust to a creature with a visible extra face, hindering all interaction tasks. The face lasts for one day per cypher level (two days if the cypher is level 6 or higher).

## HORRIFIC INTEGRATED WEAPON

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Weapon you can hold in one hand 

Effect: The weapon extends tendrils, skin, wires, nerves, or other material into and through the user’s hand, physically connecting itself to the user for one hour per cypher level. While connected, the user gains an asset on attacks with the weapon and cannot be disarmed, but cannot use that hand for anything except wielding the weapon. The user can detach or reattach the weapon by spending a full minute concentrating on its physical connection to their body. When the duration ends, the weapon detaches and becomes a normal weapon of its type. Roll a d20 to determine the kind of weapon:

| 1-4   | Hunting knife  |
|-------|----------------|
| 5-8   | Machete        |
| 9-12  | Nightstike     |
| 13-16 | Light handgun  |
| 17-20 | Medium handgun |

## HORRIFIC ORIFICE

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Device, injection, or pill  

Effect: The user’s body rapidly grows a strange orifice in their torso, large enough to fit a human fist but flexible enough to hold a compact disc or videocassette tape. One cypher held within the orifice doesn’t count toward the user’s cypher limit. As an action, the user can cause the orifice to appear or disappear (when the orifice isn’t present, anything contained within it is inaccessible except through surgery). The orifice remains for one hour per cypher level, after which it expels its contents and disappears.

Someone who fully understands how a horrific orifice cypher works might be able to program the user with new memories or control their mind by inserting data devices into the orifice.

## HUMANITY TESTER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: Reveals whether a targeted creature is human or some sort of inhuman impostor (such as an alien, demon, doppelganger, simulacrum, or vampire) if the cypher’s level is greater than the creature’s disguise level. If the cypher’s level exceeds the impostor’s level by 4 or more,

it also marks the impostor for the next several hours so people can recognize it by this mark.

> The specific nature of a humanity tester depends on the setting and what sort of creatures are common. In a world with multiple kinds of creatures that pretend to be human, the tester might recognize all fakes or detect only one specific kind of fake

## INSANITY SUPPRESSOR

Level: 1d6

Form: Device, injection, or pill

Effect: Temporarily negates insanity or a mental disorder in a creature (two such effects if the cypher level is 6 or higher). Example disorders include delusions, manias, compulsions, phobias, psychopathy, and schizophrenia. The creature loses all negative symptoms of their insanity or mental disorder for one day. Each day after that, the creature must make a level 1 Intellect defense roll to prolong the effect; failure means relapse. The roll is hindered by one step for each day that has passed since the cypher was used.

## INVISIBILITY REVEALER

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Device containing a liquid or silvery powder

Effect: Sprays its contents up to a long distance, revealing all invisible creatures within short range of the targeted point for one round per cypher level. Affected invisible creatures remain visible if they move outside the area, and those outside the area become visible if they enter the area.

## INVISIBILITY SERUM

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Device, flask, or injection 

Effect: The user’s body becomes as transparent as air, making them effectively invisible for one minute per cypher level. However, their clothes and equipment are not affected, so the user must go naked if they want to be unseen. While invisible, the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. They remain invisible even if they do something to reveal their presence or position (attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on), but anyone trying to attack or physically interact with them on that turn gains an asset to do so.

Because the user is as transparent as air, when they are in water, mist, smoke, or anything other than reasonably clean air, they look like a person-shaped hole in whatever material they’re in.

The serum has detrimental effects on the mind. Each minute it is in effect, the user takes 2 points of Intellect damage. Many users have become “stuck” in the invisible state and eventually go mad as a result.

## MIND SWAPPER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Amulet or device

Effect: The user attempts to swap minds with a creature within short range that is no larger than a human. The target can make an Intellect defense roll to resist. If the swap is successful, the user gains control of the creature’s body (and vice versa). Physical abilities remain with the body, but mental abilities go with the mind; for example, an Adept with Onslaught (a mental ability) could take over the body of a Warrior with Swipe (a physical ability), and could use either of these while controlling the Warrior’s body. All actions of both creatures are hindered while the swap is in effect, although long-term practice in a mind-swapped body eventually overcomes this penalty. The swap lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which the two minds return to their previous bodies.

> Clever users of a mind swapper have an ally restrain or sedate them before swapping minds so their target doesn’t cause trouble in the user’s body.

## PRIMITIVE DOPPELGANGER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Device, injection, or pill

Effect: The user’s body begins growing a physical duplicate of the user, which harmlessly tears free after a few rounds and exists as an independent level 1 creature that looks exactly

like the user. The doppelganger can communicate in a language known to the user and obeys the user’s simple instructions, but otherwise appears to know very little of the world. After one hour per cypher level, the duplicate dies, melts, burns out, falls apart, or otherwise becomes nonfunctional.

Depending on the game setting, the doppelganger might be a robot, a clone, a temporal duplicate, or something else entirely. It may or may not have scars, tattoos, or other non-genetic features of the original.

## REANIMATOR

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Amulet or injection

Effect: When used on a corpse of a creature no larger than a human, it reanimates as a violent zombie that is not under the user’s control. This reanimation process takes a few minutes (a few rounds if the cypher is level 4 or higher, or one round if level 6 or higher).

## REVENANT SERUM

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Injection or potion

Effect: Brings a dead person back to life for a limited time as an obsessed creature called a revenant. The cypher can be used up to an hour before or after death (in anticipation of dying or in response to someone’s death) and requires up to an hour to take effect, at which time the creature recovers 1d6 + 6 points to its Pools. The new revenant is usually obsessed with revenge on its killer or accomplishing one last task before truly dying again.

A revenant has all the abilities it had when it was alive, but all its actions are hindered. It has the same appearance as before, except the wounds that killed it are still visible, and in general it has an unnatural look. It does not need to eat, drink, or sleep, but it can still rest if it wants to (such as to make a recovery roll). The revenant remains in this active state for one hour per cypher level, after which it dies again and cannot be reanimated with this cypher.

## SILGARHO INFUSION

Level: 1d6

Form: Flask or injection

Effect: Suffuses the user’s body with a mixture of colloidal silver (sil), concentrated garlic (gar), and holy water (ho), making the user repellent to most vampires, which usually have an aversion to one or more of these materials. Vampire attacks with melee weapons against the user are hindered. Any PC vampire who attempts to feed on the user gains no sustenance and must make a Might defense roll or feel nauseous and have all their actions hindered for one minute. Any NPC vampire who attempts to feed on the user gains no sustenance and all their actions are hindered for one minute. The cypher’s effect persists in the user’s body for one day (two days if the cypher is level 4 or higher).

If used directly against a vampire instead of being applied to a living creature, it affects the vampire as silver, garlic, and holy water normally would.

Because a human body can’t dispose of colloidal silver, excessive intake of it causes a condition called argyria that turns skin purple or purple-grey

UNPHANTOMED LIMB 

​​Level: 1d6

Form: Device, injection, or pill 

Effect: Gives a user who is missing a

limb the ability to create a psychic construct in the form of a limb (two limbs if the cypher level is 5 or higher) that takes the place of and functions like their missing limb (or limbs). The unphantomed limb looks and acts like a typical healthy specimen of its kind, including having fingerprints. However, its motion is controlled by the user’s will rather than by muscles and nerves, so any physical action the limb takes is an Intellect task instead of a Might or Speed task; for example, a melee attack with the unphantomed limb is an Intellect task, and to apply Effort, the user must spend points from their Intellect Pool. Damage to the limb affects the user as if the attack were on the user’s body. The limb lasts for one day per cypher level.

## VISAGE SCRUTINIZER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Device, crystal, injection, or pill 

Effect: Grants the user a heightened

ability to see disguised people and creatures for what they really are. Tasks to see through conventional disguises (makeup, prosthetics, wigs, and so on) are eased by three steps. If the disguise is instead a comprehensive change like a full-body illusion, mental projection, or hologram, the user automatically sees through it if the disguise’s level is lower than the cypher’s level. The cypher lasts for one hour.

## WOLFSBANE POTION

Level: 1d6

Form: Flask or injection

Effect: Suffuses the user’s body with a mixture of colloidal silver and wolfsbane, making the user repellent to werewolves (and similar werecreatures). Wolfsbane is poisonous, and using this cypher inflicts Speed damage and Intellect damage equal to the cypher’s level. Werewolf attacks with melee weapons against the user are hindered. Any werewolf who attempts to feed on the user feels nauseous and all its actions are hindered for ten minutes. The cypher’s effect persists in the user’s body for one day (two days if the cypher is level 4 or higher). If used directly against a werewolf instead of being applied to a living creature, it hinders all the werewolf’s actions and stops it from regenerating for several minutes.

## FAIRYTALE CYPHERS

Because magic—and thus magic items— are so prevalent in most fairy tales, cyphers in particular should be easy for characters to replenish. If you’re using subtle cyphers, you can choose how they arrive—on magic storms, perhaps, or in pockets of magic that exist throughout the world. Or maybe the magic is such that it just works, ensuring that cyphers show up whenever the characters need them.

Manifest cyphers should be readily available too—likely they can be found for cheap at a local market, stashed in hollow tree trunks or bird nests, or scattered about the forest floor. Manifest cyphers may also be integrated into people’s clothing or furnishings as unique adornments.

Artifacts are typically more valuable and less common. Therefore, player characters are less likely to encounter them at random and more likely to find them in the hands of NPCs, locked or hidden in chests, or for sale by high-end and specialized vendors. Acquiring an artifact should almost always require a sacrifice, trial, or difficult task.

CYPHER LIMITS 

All characters have a maximum number of cyphers they can have at any one time, determined by their type. If a character ever attempts to carry more cyphers than their limit, the magic within the cyphers quickly begins to attract fey beings. Fey beings may react by stealing one or more cyphers, cursing the character, or even stealing the character away to a fey realm.

Obviously, having a fey being steal a character away to their realm

is a story-changer. If you’re using this as an option, figure out ahead of time what type of

fey is attracted, what their realm is like, and how to play out the character’s disappearance and possible retrieval.

| 5 | Causes two or more cyphers to react with each other, destroying them and inflicting damage equal to the level of the more powerful cypher |
| 6 | Steals the character away to their fey realm |

## CYPHERS  
Cyphers are one-use abilities that characters gain over the course of play. They have powers that can heal, do damage, ease or hinder tasks, or produce interesting and unusual effects. In a fairy tale setting, they often appear as a simple object, such as a poisoned apple or a matchbook. They can also be something intangible, such as three wishes or a magic word. The shifting state of magic in fairy tales makes it easy to use both manifest and subtle cyphers in the same setting and campaign if you desire.

In settings full of magic, cyphers should be both readily available and regularly used. If the PCs are hoarding or saving their cyphers, feel free to give them a reason to use them. And have a list of replacement cyphers ready so the players never have to go without.

Typically, something like a handful of magic beans or apple seeds

is considered a single cypher even though there are multiple items.

Cypher Forms

While characters can find or purchase many of these items in the world, only magic versions of the items are cyphers. Characters should easily be able to tell when an item is magic (and thus a cypher) and when it’s an ordinary item.

## A SELECTION OF FAIRY TALE CYPHERS

Adderstone

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Stone with a hole in the middle

Effect: For the next day, provides the character with one of the following benefits. Roll a d20 or choose from the table.

Adderstones are sometimes also called hagstones, seer stones, and holey stones.

Beware false adderstones, which are made by enterprising swindlers who drill or carve a hole out of a regular stone and attempt to pass it off as something more.

If a character has no hair in which to tie an adderstone, perhaps they can “borrow” some from a friend, a domesticated animal, or a foe.

| d20 | Effect |
|----|----|
| 1-3 | When looking through the hole, the user gains an asset to seeing things that are normally invisible to the eye, including doorways, beings, spirits, magical effects, and so on. |
| 4-6 | When worn on the finger as a ring, wards off spirits of the dead (grants +1 Armor against attacks from ghosts, haunts, and other spirits of the dead). |
| 7-9 | When attached to physical armor, adds 1 to the Armor it provides (adds 2 to the Armor if the cypher is level 6 or higher). |
| 10-12 | When held in the mouth, protects against poisons (up to the level of the cypher). |
| 13-15 | When placed on the finger of another with good intent, it adds 1 to the recovery rolls of both the user and the wearer. |
| 16-18 | When worn on a string around the neck, provides training in two noncombat skills of the user’s choice that they are not already trained in. |
| 19-20 | When tied in the hair, eases all defense tasks against curses by two steps. |

Agate Eye

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Striped stone that looks like a dragon’s eye

Effect: When ground up and added to food or drink, or applied to the skin, renders the user immune to poisons of the cypher level or lower for one hour per cypher level (and ends any such ongoing effects, if any, already in the user’s system).

Animated Wood

Level: 1d6

Form: Chunk of pine, alder, or other wood

imbued with magical properties Effect: Writing a word, such as “child,” “horse,” or “sword,” on the wood causes it to become a living version of that word. The living version is no bigger than 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3 m by 3 m by 6 m) and its level is equal to the cypher level. It can make attacks or perform actions as commanded to the best of its abilities and lasts for one hour per cypher level. Commanding it is not an action.

Once activated, animated wood is not an unthinking, docile being. It may, in fact, resist the user’s commands and attempt to take its own actions. Any actions it takes cannot be harmful to the user or the user’s allies. The user may attempt to stop an unwanted action via persuasion, intimidation, and so on (any such tasks against the animated wood are eased by two steps).

Anywhere Door

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Chalk, pen, pencil, lipstick, or marker 

Effect: Creates a door to anywhere. The door remains for one day, and then disappears. While the door exists, anyone or anything that can discern the door can use it. Erasing the drawn line erases the door.

Apple of Discord

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Beautiful golden apple that catches the eye of all who see it

Effect: When tossed up to a long distance away, it affects all foes in short range of the apple, causing them to attempt to take it for themselves. Foes spend their next two actions doing nothing but fighting among themselves for possession of the apple.

Bellman’s Map of the Ocean

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Blank sheet of paper rolled and tied with a hair tie

Effect: When unrolled, convinces everyone

within short range that the character holding the map knows far more than they do. For the next ten minutes, affected beings look upon the map- holder as their leader or guide, will not attack them, and generally will do as they ask (all social interactions with those affected are eased by two steps).

Beloved’s Kiss

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Ruby red ring

Effect: When pressed to the lips of a character, beloved’s kiss prevents the occurrence of one specific condition of the cypher level or lower. Additionally, it ends any such ongoing effect, if

any, in the user’s system. Roll a d6 to determine the result.

| d6 | Condition |
|----|----|
| 1-2 | Renders the character immune to poisons for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects) |
| 3-4 | Renders the character immune to curses for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects) |

Bird’s Nest Coronet

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Beautifully woven bird’s nest 

Effect: When worn like a crown, the bird’s nest creates an illusion over the wearer, making them appear like royalty. Others are more likely to follow their suggestions, defer to their wishes, and treat them well. All social interactions are eased by two steps for one day. Seeing through the disguise is an Intellect task equal to the cypher’s level.

Blackbird Pie

Level: 1d6

Form: Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie

Effect: When the pie is cut open, the blackbirds begin to sing a haunting dirge of pain and sorrow. All foes within long range who hear the song are hindered on all tasks for ten minutes.

Blood Pearl Blossom

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Rare blood-red flower with a beautiful pearl in its center

Effect: When ingested, removes one curse (of the cypher level or lower) from the user. The curse-removal process can take from one round to one day, depending on the level, severity, and type of curse.

Bone Key

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Human finger bone carved into a skeleton key

Effect: Unlocks one lock of the cypher level or lower, or provides an asset to open a lock of higher level.

Bones of the Beloved

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Handful of ground bones 

Effect: When eaten, the bones begin a process of lowering the eater’s apparent age. Over the next three days, the user begins to look younger and younger, until they reach the appearance of someone no younger than their mid-twenties. Their hair shines, their teeth glow, their wrinkles disappear, their back unstoops. The effect lasts for three days (five days if the cypher is level 6 or higher). This does not change the actual health or age of the character.

Bowl of Porridge

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Just-right bowl of porridge

Effect: Restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the user’s Might Pool. Also protects the user from the effects of cold for ten minutes.

Effect: When activated, the medallion protects the wearer from the next curse (of the cypher level or lower) that is cast upon them. The curse goes into the medallion, which shatters into thousands of tiny pieces.

Cheshire Smile

Level: 1d6

Form: Mischievous grin

Effect: When hung in the air, the grin slowly transforms into a grey Cheshire Cat that seems to be made mostly of smoke and shadow. It has huge blue eyes and an enormous grin. The cat acts as a creature (level equal to the cypher’s level) with a mind of its own, although it likely helps the person who activated the cypher. It sticks around for ten minutes, and then fades away slowly, until even the original smile has disappeared.

Coalheart’s Beard Balm

Level: 1d6

Form: Jar of balm

Effect: When rubbed on the face, the balm grows into a long, golden beard in about ten minutes. When the user tugs on their beard, it points them in the direction of valuable treasure, the location of which was previously unknown to the user. If someone else cuts the beard before the treasure is found, it loses its power. After the treasure is found, the beard remains. But once it is shaved or cut, it does not grow back.

Many dwarfs have beards with magical powers. It’s possible to find other beard balm cyphers out in the world.

Croc’s Clock

Level: 1d6

Form: Tiny ticking clock, no bigger than a thumbnail

Effect: When attached to (or swallowed by) a living creature or an object, the clock ticks loudly, alerting everyone within long range to its presence for one day.

Crown Jewel

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Shining jewel from a royal crown 

Effect: When attached to an item such as a weapon, shield, armor, cypher, or artifact, creates an exact duplicate of the item. The duplicate works just like the original and lasts for ten minutes or until it naturally depletes (whichever comes first).

Darning Needle

Level: 1d6

Form: Needle with a large eye

Effect: When activated, grows into a larger version of itself that acts as a medium weapon. It inflicts 4 points of damage and causes anything it successfully hits to shrink to half its size. The needle lasts for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level.

Dead Water

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Vial, pot, or jar of black liquid 

Effect: Brings a character back to life. However, they come back with a permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Might Pool.

Deathless

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Needle inside an egg

Effect: When a character places their soul inside the needle and places the needle inside the egg, they are protected from their next death. When the character dies, they return to life on the next round, with all of their Pools full.

Using the deathless does not protect the character from taking damage or moving down the damage track. Placing the soul and returning to life are actions. Once the cypher holds the user’s soul, it no longer counts against their cypher limit.

If someone gets a hold of another person’s soul, they have a great deal of power over that person (such as easing all actions against them by three steps). Those who use a deathless should ensure that it’s well hidden and well protected.

Death’s Candle

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small, half-burnt black candle 

Effect: Once the candle is lit, it burns for a number of rounds equal to the cypher’s level. During that time, the user who lit it is protected from death or being moved down the damage track. While the candle burns, if the character would normally die, they do not and instead reject all damage. For example, if a character has 5 points left in their last Pool, and a foe inflicts 5 points

of damage on them, putting all their Pools at 0, the user takes no damage. However, if a foe inflicts 4 points of damage, which is not enough to kill the user, the user takes the 4 points of damage.

Death’s Messengers

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bottle, vial, or box filled with three wisps of dark smoke

Effect: The three smoke wisps wrap around a creature within close range, causing them to feel dizzy, experience ringing in their ears, and have blurred vision. For the next three rounds, the cypher inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s level (each round).

Diadem of Death

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Crown made of feathers, bits of bone, burnt hair, and old teeth

Effect: When worn on someone’s head, looped over a limb, or otherwise placed upon their person, the crown inflicts damage equal to its level.

|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | +2 to Armor                                              |
| 3-4 | Asset to all tasks involving magic                       |
| 5-6 | Asset to all tasks involving romance, sex, and fertility |

Dragon’s Teeth

Level: 1d6

Form: Handful of dragon’s teeth

Effect: When planted, the dragon’s teeth grow into three fully armed warriors. The warriors can understand the verbal commands of the person who planted them. Once they are grown, commanding them is not an action. They can make attacks and perform actions to the best of their abilities. The warriors can never go farther than long range from the character who planted them

Planting the teeth is an action. It takes two rounds for the teeth to grow into warriors. The warriors last for one hour per cypher level.

Warriors: level 3; Armor 1; swords inflict 3 points of damage

Dressmaking Nut

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Walnut or other shelled nut, with hinges and a clasp

Effect: The nut opens to reveal a stunning and spectacular ballgown, evening dress, or tuxedo. The outfit is the perfect size, shape, style, and color for the person who wishes to wear it. While worn, the outfit eases all tasks involving charm, persuasion, and etiquette for one hour. After 

that, the outfit may still be worn, but no longer offers any benefits.

Beings of all genders can wear any form of outfit from the dressmaking nut and receive the benefits.

Drink Me

Level: 1d6

Form: Liquid inside a glass bottle with a paper label that says “DRINK ME” 

Effect: Causes the imbiber to shrink down to half their size. The effect lasts for one hour or until the user can find another way to change their size (such as with an eat me).

Dust of the Dreamer

Level: 1d6

Form: Pouch of very fine, rainbow-hued dust 

Effect: When sprinkled in the eyes, grants the recipient all the benefits of a ten-hour recovery roll as a single action. This does not use up any of their recovery rolls.

Eat Me

Level: 1d6

Form: Very small cake with the words “EAT ME” written on it in currants

Effect: Causes the eater to grow to twice their size. The effect lasts for one hour or until the user can find another way to change their size (such as with a drink me).

Level: 1d6

Form: Magical thread sewn onto armor 

Effect: For the next day, the armor the thread is attached to is invisible, making the wearer appear to be unarmored.

Fairy Cup

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Decorated vessel made of precious materials

Effect: When the cup is buried in the ground, it grants the person who buried it protection. They gain +2 Armor against all physical and mental attacks for one day.

It’s believed that burying a fairy cup returns it to its rightful owners below ground, and it is they who offer protection by way of thanks.

False Grandmother

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Pair of wire-rimmed glasses

Effect: While wearing the glasses, the user designates one living creature that

they can see. For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user is disguised as someone the designated creature knows well. The user has no say in who that person is, but while the disguise is active, all interactions with the designated creature are eased by two steps. The user can remove the glasses to look like themselves again before the end of the duration.

Father’s Betrayal

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small stone shaped like a heart 

ffect: For the next ten minutes, a creature that the user can see is banished from an area 30 feet by 30 feet (9 m by 9 m) around the user. If the creature is within that area when the cypher is activated, they are knocked outside the area and are dazed for one round, hindering their next action.

Flaming Arrow

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Arrow with a silver-white shaft, golden head, and fletching of peacock feathers 

Effect: The arrow explodes into flame when it strikes something, inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range.

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Length of magical rope

Effect: Knotting the rope together to form a loop allows the user to capture a memory from their past. They don’t lose the memory when capturing it with the forget-me-knot. When the user unties the loop, everyone in close range spends one round doing nothing but experiencing the memory as if it were their own. If the memory is particularly sad, loving, scary, and so on, all affected beings likely spend an additional round dealing with the emotional impacts of that memory. Capturing the memory is an action, as is untying the loop.

Genie’s Handkerchief

Level: 1d6

Form: Extremely large handkerchief with one corner coated in mercury

Effect: Rubbing the cloth over a wound heals the wound (restores all points to the character’s Pools), but also uses up one recovery roll for the day.

Genie’s handkerchiefs come in many colors and materials. Some people find that after

their magic is used up, they make fine blankets, curtains, or cloaks. Of course, extended exposure to mercury has its drawbacks.

Gilded Shell

Level: 1d6

Form: Golden snail shell

Effect: When blown into softly, the shell expands into a simple structure with a front door and walls that let in a soft light. From inside the structure, it’s about 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3

m by 3 m by 6 m). From the outside, the shell continues to look exactly the way it did before, in both size and shape, making it difficult for others to notice. Once expanded, the structure is permanent and immobile.

Gingerbread Man

Level: 1d6

Form: Gingerbread cookie in the shape of a human, lavishly decorated

Effect: After eating the cookie, the user has training in Speed defense for the next day.

Godfather’s Picture Book

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Large book full of tales

Effect: When someone flips through the pages quickly, time is altered. If the user flips through the book forward, time jumps forward. Flip backward and time jumps backward. Moving time forward gives the user an additional action on their turn. Moving it backward allows them to retry their previous action. After the book is used this way once, it becomes a regular book and does not count against the character’s cypher limit.

Golden Beetle

Level: 1d6

Form: Golden scarab beetle

Effect: When dropped into liquid and cooked, it creates enough food to fill the stomachs of all friends and allies within long range.

Golden Vanity

Level: 1d6

Form: Golden vanity set in a small, sturdy box that includes a brush, comb, and mirror

Effect: Each item may be used once and has a different effect:

Golden brush: Creates bristly terrain in an immediate area, which counts as difficult terrain.

Golden comb: Creates jagged, toothy rocks in an immediate area, making it extremely painful to cross. Characters within the area take 1 point of damage each round from the rocks.

Golden mirror: Turns into a tall glass mountain 30 feet tall by 300 feet wide (9 m by 90 m). All climbing tasks are hindered, and a fall from any height does 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).

The landscape effects are permanent. The golden vanity counts as a single cypher against the character’s cypher limit. When all three items have been used, it remains a functional vanity set but no longer holds any magic.

Green Spectacles

Level: 1d6

Form: Pair of glasses with bright green lenses

Effect: Once activated, protects the wearer from being blinded or having their vision affected in other ways for one day. The wearer can see through illusions of the cypher level or lower and can see in the dark as if it were daylight.

Heart of a Star

Level: 1d6

Form: Still-warm piece of a fallen star 

Effect: For the next ten minutes, when the user helps another character while holding the star, that character’s task is eased by an additional step. (If the user has an inability in the relevant skill, the other character’s task is still eased.)

Iron Bands of Three

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Three flexible iron bands

Effect: Wrapping the iron bands around the user’s heart keeps it from breaking with trouble and anxiety. While wearing the bands, the user automatically succeeds on their next three Intellect defense rolls against anything that would make them feel sad, fearful, intimidated, and so on. Each time the cypher activates to protect the user, one of the bands breaks. When all three bands are broken, the cypher is used up.

Itsy Bitsy Spider

Level: 1d6

Form: Tiny spider inside a jar, box, or thimble

Effect: When released, the spider sets up a web in a nearby corner. For the next ten minutes, the web catches thoughts, secrets, and information about the general area (up to about a square mile), including any creatures, people, weather, or goings on. At the end of that time, the user can read the web, gaining answers to a number of questions equal to the cypher’s level. The questions must pertain to the area and must be simple enough that the spider can answer them in three words or less.

Jack’s Candlestick

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Burning candlestick

Effect: Jumping over the candlestick restores a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to the user’s Speed Pool.

Effect: Allows the user to retry a task that they failed within the past minute, using the same difficulty and modifiers.

The Key of Knowing

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Golden key that is permanently stained with blood

Effect: When used to open a lock (of the cypher level or lower), grants the user the opportunity to ask three yes-or-no questions about a person, place, or thing. The key answers to the best of its ability and knowledge, and it does not attempt to lie or trick the user with its answer.

After the key is used in this way, the blood disappears from its surface and the key refuses to open anything (or speak) ever again.

Knave of Hearts

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Playing card depicting an elegant knight

Effect: Turns the user into the knight depicted on the card. They take on the appearance, voice, and mannerisms of the knight. They also gain +1 Armor, +1 damage, and an asset in sneaking, hiding, and stealth. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.

Lion’s Courage

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Small medallion with the word “COURAGE” inscribed upon it.

Form: Vial, pot, or jar of liquid

Effect: Removes any ongoing damage, lasting damage, or permanent damage the character has. However, the character has a permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Might Pool.

When dead water and living water cyphers are used together, a dead character can be brought back to life without any permanent reductions of their Might Pool.

Magic Beans

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Handful of magic beans

Effect: When planted and watered, the beans grow into a giant beanstalk. It’s almost impossible to know where the beanstalk leads until you climb it. Climbing the beanstalk is a level 5 task.

Memory’s Match

Level: 1d6

Form: Matchbox with one match inside 

Effect: Lighting the match causes everyone nearby to see a vision that comforts them. Those who watch the vision in the flame for one round feel rejuvenated and comforted. Anyone who makes a recovery roll in the next ten minutes gains +3 to the roll. After that, anyone who watched the vision but didn’t make a recovery roll takes 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).

Mermaid Tear

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tear-shaped drop of sea glass

Effect: When swallowed, fills the user with an overwhelming sense of sadness. The user takes 1 point of Intellect damage, but gains an asset on any tasks involving water for the next ten minutes. The task must involve water in a significant way (for example, swinging a sword while it’s raining likely doesn’t count, but crying as part of an attempt to persuade someone, casting a magic spell involving water, or using a pool to scry would all be appropriate).

Neverlost

Level: 1d6

Form: Bag of bread crumbs, pebbles, or candy

Effect: When dropped along a path or trail,

the items become invisible to everyone except the user and any allies the user designates. The items last for one day per cypher level and can be seen by the user and their allies, even in complete darkness.

Nonsensical Poem

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Nonsense poem written in mirror writing

Effect: Reading the poem aloud lets the user reverse one thing about their present situation for up to ten minutes. Up becomes down. Gravity works the other way. A river flows backward. The sun shines at night. (The player should work with the GM to come up with an appropriate and acceptable change.)

Omniscient Bean

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Magical bean made into a cake 

Effect: When eaten, the bean allows the

user to tap into magic. They can ask the GM one question related to their current task, location, or action and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find by looking somewhere other than their current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. The cypher cannot provide an answer to a question above its level (which means it can’t provide knowledge about the future, since that is level 10).

Pictureless Book

Level: 1d6

Form: Book without pictures

Effect: Reading the book aloud for one round causes all who hear it within short range (except the user) to fall into a deep sleep for one round. While they sleep, they have intense dreams and cannot take any other actions. The dreams affect them in one of the following ways.

Pictureless book affects NPCs’ health instead of their Pools, either restoring them to full health or doing 5 points of damage.

| d6 | Effect |
|----|----|
| 1-2 | Sweet dreams. All dreaming characters have all of their Pools restored to full. |
| 3-4 | Nightmares. All dreaming characters take 5 points of Intellect damage. |
| 5-6 | Dream world. All dreaming characters enter a dream world, where they have an experience that causes them to temporarily learn a noncombat skill of their choice for the rest of the day. |

Poison for Your Daughter 

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Clear liquid that can be spread on any object, such as an apple, hair comb, or weapon

Effect: The poison creates a specific reaction for one hour in a creature who uses the object. Roll d100 to determine the reaction.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 7%" />
<col style="width: 92%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>d100</th>
<th>Reaction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
| 01-20 | Sleep. The creature falls into a deep, dreamless sleep. While sleeping, the creature cannot take any actions, but is protected by a glass coffin that grants +2 Armor. The creature wakes if they are touched by someone they love or if they take damage. |
| 21-40 | Disappear. The creature becomes invisible to everyone and everything for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. During that time, they cannot be heard, felt, or sensed. |
| 41-60 | Alter. The creature becomes physically altered until they are unrecognizable, even by their loved ones. The alteration also affects their clothing, possessions, and any distinguishing characteristics or mannerisms.  |
| 61-75 | Lost. The creature becomes deeply and frighteningly lost, even if they are in familiar surroundings (such as their own bedroom). They do not recognize any landmarks, cannot find their way, and feel a deep sense of panic. |
| 76-85 | Breathless. The creature feels like they are unable to breathe, gulping air and short of breath. Although they are not dying, they feel as though they are. All tasks are hindered.  |
| 86-95 | Compulsion. The creature becomes obsessed with a single task, unable to do anything else until they achieve it. The task might be simple (picking the most beautiful rose from a garden) or complex (knitting seven sweaters from nettles). All actions that don’t contribute to completing the task are hindered.  |
| 96-00 | Dutiful. The creature becomes much easier to interact with. All tasks to influence the poisoned creature are eased by two steps. |

Poisoned Apple

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Apple that is half white and half red 

Effect: Eating from the white half heals the user, restoring a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to their Might Pool. Eating from the red half poisons the user, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level. Each half of the apple has the power to affect only one creature.

Both halves of the apple can be used by the same or different people as long as it’s done within a few rounds of each other. However, in order for the cypher to take effect, the user must willingly take a bite. It’s impossible, for instance, to force-feed someone part of the apple and have the cypher activate.

Poppet (Damage)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small figure made of cloth, stuffed with hair and bone

Effect: Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure connects the figure with that object or being. Destroying the poppet inflicts damage on the connected object or being equal to the cypher’s level, no matter how far away it is. Writing the name and destroying the poppet are separate actions.

Poppet (Love)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small figure made of wax, adorned with flowers and herbs

Effect: Giving the poppet to another living being in a short ceremony (usually simply saying the being’s name and making an offer of deep positive emotion) protects them from all harmful effects the next time they are attacked. If the positive emotion is returned (such as between friends or lovers), the giver is also protected. For example, the next time someone swings a sword, speaks a curse, or tries to poison the creature, the attempt automatically fails, and if the creature were to slip near a deep pit, they would not fall into it. Giving the poppet to another is an action.

Poppet (Prosperity)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small figure made of cloth, stuffed with herbs and bits of wood

Effect: Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure connects the figure with that object or being. Dirtying, tearing, and damaging the poppet causes the connected being or object to appear destitute and poor to all who see them. This effect lasts for a day. Writing the name and damaging the poppet are separate actions.

Poppet (Silence)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small figure carved from wood or stone, with an open mouth 

Effect: Stuffing the open mouth with something that belongs to a living being (such as hair, teeth, or fabric) connects the figure to that being. For the following day, the being is unable to talk about, point to, see, or otherwise engage with the person who activated the poppet.

Powder of Life

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Bit of powder carried in a pepper box 

Effect: When sprinkled on an inanimate

object, the powder brings it to life. The object doesn’t change in any way—a small cat made of glass remains a small cat made of glass—except that now it is alive. The living object acts as a level 2 creature with a mind of its own. While it has an affinity or obligation for the one who brought it to life, it doesn’t obey commands.

Objects animated by the powder of life should have stats that represent

their form and nature. For example, a tin soldier brought to life likely has 1 Armor and perhaps a light weapon, while a stuffed rabbit might be level 3 for the purpose of Speed defense, hiding, and sneaking.

Princess’s Pea

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Dried pea that was previously slept on 

Effect: For one hour per cypher level, allows the user to recognize disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, false claims, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are.

Rabbit Hole

Level: 1d6

Form: Pocket watch with an empty face 

Effect: Laying the pocket watch facedown on the ground creates a rabbit hole that goes directly to a place that the user states. The user must have previously been to the stated place, and must enter the rabbit hole before anyone else, ideally by jumping in feet first. The hole grows to the appropriate size to accommodate the user and anyone traveling with them. Travel inside the hole is not instantaneous, but it is very fast, taking no more than a minute and feeling very much like riding a long, winding slide. 

The hole stays open for ten minutes, and it is possible to travel back to the starting place (but nowhere else) by again jumping in feet-first.

Rapunzel Leaf

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Small green leaf from a rapunzel plant

Effect: After being buried beneath a rock, the rapunzel leaf begins to grow into a stone tower that stands 100 feet (30 m) tall. The tower, which takes ten minutes to fully form, has a large number of windows but only one exterior door, which can be unlocked only by the user.

The tower’s level is equal to the cypher level, and the structure is permanent and immobile.

Rose of Red

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Big, beautiful crimson rose in full bloom

Effect: Pricking a finger on the rose’s thorns causes the user to bleed a single drop of blood. When flung into the air, the blood becomes a large red bird that flies toward a chosen target up to a long distance away. When it arrives, it bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting Intellect damage equal to the cypher level. The burst spawns 1d6 additional birds; in the next round, each one flies to a random spot within short range and explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level.

Shadow Soap

Level: 4

Form: Small piece of soap

Effect: When rubbed on your visible shadow, causes it to separate from yourself.

The shadow acts as a level 4 creature under the user’s control for one hour (or until there is no light). The shadow is two-dimensional and insubstantial, and when sneaking, hiding, and avoiding detection, it acts as a level 7 creature. When the effect ends, the shadow (usually) returns to the user.

Shadows are known to develop a mind of their own. Sometimes after tasting a bit of freedom, they refuse to return.

Shard of the Moon

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tiny sliver of the moon

Effect: Glows softly for ten minutes, drawing all moon-loving creatures (such as moths, moon hares, and werewolves) within long range. For as long as the effect lasts, any attracted creatures will not attack the user or their allies. The user can converse with the creatures and ask them questions, which the creatures will answer to the best of their ability, but always within their nature (so a trickster will still answer as a trickster would, for example).

Shining Knife

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Shining knife

Effect: When stuck into an object, such as a tree or the side of a house, the knife connects the wielder and someone they choose. If one of them wants to know how the other is faring, all they have to do is return to the spot where the knife is stuck. If both are faring well, the knife shines bright gold. If harm has come to one, the knife is dull and rusted.

Silver Slippers

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Silver shoes, ruby slippers, or red boots

Effect: When the wearer speaks aloud the name of the place they wish to go,

the silver slippers take them there in three steps. Note that in most cases the slippers only transport the wearer (although companion animals and the like may sometimes travel with them).

Once the silver slippers are used to transport their wearer, they disappear. However,

it is rumored that they magically return to the world in some form for someone else who needs them.

Singing Bone

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Human bone carved into the mouthpiece for a musical instrument Effect: When blown into, the bone sings a

song that details the weaknesses and faults of one target (up to the level of the cypher) that the user chooses. For ten minutes, all tasks involving the target are eased for everyone in long range who heard the bone’s song.

For most magical objects involving sound, it’s not necessary to physically hear the item in order to gain the benefits. “Hearing” may involve sensing vibrations, magical mental telepathy, a sign language interpreter, and so on.

Snake Leaves

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Three green leaves

Effect: When placed upon a person, the leaves restore all Pools to full, move

a character one step up the damage track, or bring a dead character back to life. However, the character also gains a permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Intellect Pool.

Snickersnee

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small jewel, talisman, or bead 

Effect: When attached to a weapon, causes it to grow two to five times its normal size. The weapon inflicts an additional +2 points of damage, but otherwise can be used as if it were a weapon of its original size.

Song of the Dead

Level: 1d6

Form: Small stuffed bird with yellow and blue plumage

Effect: When the user spends ten minutes breathing into the mouth of the bird, it comes to life. It flies off, but now carries a piece of the user’s life inside it. When the user dies, the bird flies back to their body and is able to communicate to those around it, but only for one day. After that, the bird returns to its lifeless form.

Sorcerer’s Skeleton Key

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Wooden stick, iron wand, or piece of straw

Effect: When tapped three times against any locked door or other object (of the cypher level or lower), the key automatically unlocks it.

Spirit Ring

Level: 1d6

Form: Ring, necklace, hairpin, or bracelet 

Effect: Summons a group of helpful fey who provide assistance for ten minutes. During this time, they do as the wearer commands as long as they’re within long range. They can hinder any or all opponents’ tasks, provide information, assist in small tasks, and so on. The fey will not do anything that goes against their basic nature and safety (such as self-harm, attacking their friends, or obvious suicide missions).

Fey are fickle beings. While spirit rings and the like allow someone to hold power over them, it’s very much dependent on the fey’s blessing. Angering the fey may cause them to leave at any moment (even in the middle of something important), and they may take the time to curse or prank the characters before they disappear.

Teleport Hat

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Silly hat that is always too large on the wearer no matter what size their head is

Effect: Allows the wearer to wish for a creature that they know to appear at their side. The creature must agree to be teleported (or convinced via some type of interaction, such as persuasion or intimidation). The teleported creature stays for as long as both parties agree, but not more than a day. At that time, the creature is returned to their place of origination.

Three Needles

Level: 1d6

Form: Three enchanted needles

Effect: For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user can climb any solid surfaces (even vertical ones) as if doing so was a routine task.

Tin Man’s Tears

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tiny vial filled with tears

Effect: When poured out, spreads out to cover an area about 2 feet by 2 feet (60 cm square), transforming any metal it touches into brittle rust, down to a depth of about 6 inches (15 cm). When used on a metal creature (such as a tin soldier), the rust inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s level and hinders all movement actions for ten minutes.

To Peter With Love

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Wrapped box with a bomb inside and a gift tag on the outside

Effect: Write a person’s name on the tag, and the box will deliver itself to that person at a time and place you specify. When opened, the box does damage to the recipient equal to the cypher level. Traveling to the recipient takes at least a round and sometimes longer, depending on the distance and difficulty.

Valorous Whetstone

Level: 1d6

Form: Sharpening stone

Effect: After sharpening at least one of their weapons with the whetstone, the user instantly feels more brave. For the next ten minutes, all of their intimidation actions are eased, and their sharpened weapon inflicts +2 points of damage.

Vase of Tears

Level: 1d6

Form: Vase, vial, or jar filled with tears 

Effect: Breaking the vase creates a protective spell around the character, preventing them from taking any Might damage the next time they are physically attacked.

White Snake

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Piece of a magical snake

Effect: Upon swallowing the piece of the snake, the user gains the ability to understand and speak with all living things for ten minutes.

Wish-Granting Pearl

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Flaming pearl

Effect: The user can make a single wish and have all or part of it come true. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The cypher cannot grant a wish above its level.

Witch Bottle

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Ornate stoppered bottle filled with wine, seawater, or pins and needles 

Effect: Captures a witch (of a level up to the cypher’s level). Upon entering the bottle, the witch takes damage equal to the cypher’s level and is trapped until someone whispers their name into the bottle’s mouth and releases them.

Witch’s Ladder

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Garland of knotted string, feathers, teeth, and bells

Effect: Safely stores one curse for use at a later time. The stored curse may be released and cast only by the person who stored it, or by someone who has received their permission to do so.

Wooden Spoon

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Plain wooden spoon

Effect: When stirred through the air, restores the user’s energy and vitality. The user gains two additional actions on their next turn. For example, they can move a long distance, use a one-action recovery roll, and activate a cypher as their turn, or attack a foe three times.

Yonder Yarn

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Skein or spool of yarn

Effect: Unravels to lead the user to their desired destination. The yarn unspools at the speed that the user would normally walk or ride. The yonder yarn will not enter territory it deems too dangerous, and it cannot go through solid obstacles. If the yarn is cut, it no longer works.

It is difficult, but not impossible, to protect oneself from being found by yonder yarn. Witches, in particular, know ways to hide themselves (and others) from the yarn’s power.

## ARTIFACTS

## MODERN MAGIC ARTIFACTS

If cyphers are the expendable magic that is ever-present in fantasy, artifacts are the more durable magic items that can be used over and over again—tomes of weird magic, magical vehicles, and so on. Unlike cyphers, there is no limit to how many artifacts a character can bear.

Artifact Rules

Artifacts are more powerful than common equipment or cyphers.

Each artifact has a level and a rate of power depletion. When an artifact is used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d00). If the die shows the depletion number(s), the item works, but that is its last use. A depletion entry of “—” means that the artifact never depletes, and an entry of “automatic” means that it can be used only once.

Depowered artifacts can sometimes be recharged using the repair rules, depending on the item’s nature. Other special abilities can also repower an expended item, but probably for only one use. Powerful magical creatures might be able to recharge artifacts, at least temporarily.

Example Modern Fantasy Artifacts

Accessories Sold Separately

Level: 1d6

Form: Articulated action figure that comes equipped with a number of accessories, such as a gun, armor, handbag, laptop computer, dazzling outfit, and so on.

Effect: The action figure carries a number of accessories equal to the artifact level. When the button on their back is pushed, the action figure does nothing, but their accessories grow to the size they would be if they were real, and they become functional. They remain this way for a day.

Roll a d20 for each accessory the action figure might carry.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

| D20 | Accessory |
|----|----|
| 1 | Light weapon (includes ammo) |
| 2 | Medium weapon (includes ammo) |
| 3 | Heavy weapon (includes ammo) |
| 4 | Light armor |
| 5 | Medium armor |
| 6 | Heavy armor |
| 7 | Laptop computer |
| 8 | Cell phone |
| 9 | Doctor bag (eases healing tasks) |
| 10 | Dazzling outfit (eases social interactions) |
| 11 | Handbag (includes a handful of items, such as gum, lipstick, sunglasses, and a notebook) |
| 12 | Bag of light tools |
| 13 | Puppy (level 1) |
| 14 | Kitten (level 1) |
| 15 | Dinosaur (level 1) |
| 16 | Fiction book |
| 17 | Nonfiction book |
| 18 | Backpack (empty) |
| 19 | Guitar |
| 20 | Inflatable couch |

Ask Me Anything

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Magic billiard ball fill with liquid, inside of which a small gargoyle, crow, or other creature floats

Effect: The user can shake the magic ball, causing the creature inside to wake up. They can ask the creature two questions about the future and learn the answer (three questions if the artifact is level 4 or higher, four questions if the artifact is level 6 or higher). Because the future is ever-changing, the answers may not line up perfectly with what will happen, but they usually offer at least one piece of concrete, actionable information.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Atheneum of the Mind Card

Level: 1d6

Form: Metal and glass card about the size and shape of a library card

Effect: Allows the user to “borrow” people’s minds the same way that one might borrow a library book. The person must be agreeable to sharing their knowledge and must be within short range of the user when the exchange happens. For the next 24 hours, the user has access to the person’s brain from anywhere, allowing them to become trained in two noncombat skills or specialized in one noncombat skill. The skill they choose must make sense for the person whose brain they’re “borrowing” (for example, a professor of English lit would likely be skilled in speed-reading and storytelling, but maybe not in woodworking or cooking). They can only borrow one person’s mind each day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d00

Attempted Murder

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Tattoo of a flock of crows located anywhere on the body

Effect: When the tattoo is activated, the crows fly out of it in a barrage of attacks. Everyone and everything in an immediate area suffers damage equal to the artifact level, unless they are designated safe by the user ahead of time.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (when the artifact depletes, the tattoo flies away and disappears)

Battery of the Vanquished

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Small metal pipe that’s been etched with elaborate symbols

Effect: After killing a magical creature, the user can place the pipe against the body and suck the creature’s magic up into their body. The creature must have been slain by the user, they must be magical in some way, and they must have died within the last hour. The user restores a number of points equal to the artifact level to their Intellect Pool (even if this temporarily puts them above their maximum Pool).

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Blade of the Roses

> Level: 1d6 + 2
>
> Form: Handcrafted sword etched with vines and roses
>
> Effect: This sword is a medium weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage (6 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). Additionally, on the first successful attack against a foe, the sword sows a rose vine into the creature’s heart. The vine begins to spread through the creature’s veins, inflicting 2 additional points of damage each round for one day or until magic is used to remove the vine. A PC can end the effect early by succeeding on a Might defense roll on their turn.

Depletion: 1 in 1d00 (check each first successful attack)

Book of the Baker

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Pocket-sized book with a well-worn leather cover filled with handwritten recipes
>
> Effect: Taking a round to read a recipe from the book aloud causes everyone within short range to feel as if they’ve eaten the meal from the recipe. They all add +1 to their recovery rolls for the next ten minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Breakaway Bag

> Level: 1d6 + 4
>
> Form: Backpack, purse, or duffel covered in patches
>
> Effect: This bag can hold a number of magic items (including cyphers and artifacts) equal to the artifact level. Every item the user places inside the bag instantly turns into a patch on the bag’s surface. Only the user can recognize these patches as the objects they once were, and only the user can turn them back into their original items (doing so takes an action). The bag can also be used as a regular bag to hold mundane items, which does not affect how many magic items it can hold. Cyphers in the bag do not count against the user’s cypher limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (roll each time a magic item is added)

Busy Box

Level: 1d6

Form: Small wooden box with a remote opener

Effect: Opening the box reveals a dazzling array of enticing things to do, see, hear, and experience. These enticements are magically geared to those experiencing them. Everyone who fails an Intellect defense roll within short range of the box is so distracted that they’re hindered on all actions for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. (NPCs whose level is less than the artifact level are automatically affected.) The remote will open and close the box from up to long range away.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Cats Hide Their Paws

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Onyx ring that depicts a cat curling around itself, so that it becomes a feline ouroboros

Effect: The ring allows the user to slink into the shadows, hide their true motives, and otherwise go mostly unseen and unnoticed. This provides an asset to sneaking, lockpicking, disguise, and deception tasks.

Depletion: 1 in 1d00 (check each day)

Cloud Storage

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Palm-sized device with a carabiner attached

Effect: Stores up to five cypher apps at a time. The device is thumbprint-protected by the user, and only the user can add apps and activate them. Any additional apps stored above the user’s cypher limit do not count against the limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time an app is added)

Cloud Thief

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Ring that alters to perfectly fit the wearer (in size and appearance)
>
> Effect: Allows the user to copy a cypher app from any device the user chooses within long range. The ring chooses randomly from the available apps on that device, and the user doesn’t know what the app is until they receive it. They can activate the cypher app directly from the ring or download it into a device of their choice. The ring can only hold one app at a time, and that app does count against the user’s cypher limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Color Cannon

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Can of spray paint modified to spray from three different nozzles
>
> Effect: Depending on which nozzle is used, the color cannon has the following effects with a successful attack roll by the user.
>
> Fear. Sprays a target within short range with a beam of color that frightens them so badly that they flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.
>
> Stun. Sprays a target within short range with a beam of color that stuns them for one round, making them lose their next action.
>
> Tag. Tags a target within long range with a symbol. All tasks involving tracking, following, and finding that target are eased for the next day. No matter where the symbol lands, the tag still works (for example, if the target’s shirt is tagged, the tag works even if they remove their shirt).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Combat Glasses

> Level: 1d6 + 2
>
> Form: Pair of stylish sunglasses
>
> Effect: The glasses analyze a foe and display information about the best places to strike them as well as how best to avoid their incoming attacks. If the user spends an action to allow the glasses to analyze a chosen foe, they gain an asset in both melee attacks and Speed defense rolls against the foe. They must take a separate action to analyze each foe, and the glasses can only assist against one foe at a time.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check after each foe)

Crow Friend

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Pocket-sized figurine of a crow, its feathers worn from being lovingly petted over time

Effect: For as long as the user carries the figurine on their person and does not actively harm, scare, or otherwise offend any living corvids, a flock of crows may show up randomly once per day to assist them. The crows arrive on their own time and act as crows do, attempting to help the user in the way that they deem most useful, such as dropping stones on a foe’s head, warning them of incoming dangers, bringing them a snack, and so on.

Depletion: 1 in 1d00 (roll each time the crows arrive)

Crown of the High King

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Pair of over-the-ear headphones that sparkle in the light

Effect: When worn, the headphones provide the user with an enhanced sense of elegance, power, or status. Other people find themselves drawn to the user in the hopes of helping them, granting their wishes, and treating them like the royalty they obviously are. All social interactions are eased.

Depletion: 1 in 1d00 (roll each day)

Dragon Pen

> Level: 1d6 + 2
>
> Form: Quill made from a green feather
>
> Effect: The user can dip the pen in ink and draw an object or creature, which becomes real for one minute. The object or creature’s level is half the artifact’s level, +1 level if the user is trained in drawing, or +2 levels if the user is specialized in drawing. Once released from the page or surface it was drawn upon, the object or creature swells until it reaches the appropriate size, but it grows no bigger than an immediate distance in width, depth, and height. If a creature is made, it does the bidding of the user.
>
> Someone familiar with magic made from drawings or illustrations, such as someone who has the Inks Spells on Skin focus, can use the pen as part of casting their spells, easing the task of casting the spell.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Eau de Blood of Monsters

> Level: 1d6 + 4
>
> Form: Red crystal bottle filled with amber perfume
>
> Effect: This perfume is specially created to be used by a single person. To activate it for the first time, the user must put a single drop of their blood into the bottle, incorporating their own scent into that of the perfume. The result smells amazing to them but is not noticeable to anyone else.
>
> After that, whenever the user applies the perfume, it provides +2 Armor (+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher). Each application lasts for ten minutes per artifact level, and it’s an action to reapply the perfume.
>
> Anyone else who attempts to wear the perfume quickly realizes it smells awful on their skin, and they take 1 point of damage.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Ecosensitive Fridge Magnets

Level: 1d6

Form: Set of refrigerator magnets (two of each letter and two of each number 0 through 9) made out of bone or wood

Effect: Ghosts, haunts, wraiths, poltergeists, and other spectral creatures can move these objects as easily as a human can, using them to spell out messages visible to anyone in the area. Usually, the magnets are also enchanted so these creatures can’t remove them from the surface they’re attached to (preventing the creatures from stealing, hiding, or throwing them).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day of use); depletion means one of the magnets is lost forever but the remainder continue to function

Flying Carpet

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Small woven rug, large enough for several people to sit on

Effect: The carpet flies a long distance each round, carrying up to five passengers. It flies for up to ten hours per activation. When traveling overland, the artifact can achieve a flying speed of 60 miles (97 km) per hour.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Gift from the Fairy Queen Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Glass eye that shines with a beautiful inner light

Effect: Looking through the glass eye allows the user to see anything that’s hidden or invisible, including magic, up to the level of the artifact. If they have the glass eye surgically or magically implanted (a task equal to the artifact level), they also gain an asset in using magic in all its forms, including crafting, combat, and defenses.

Depletion: —

Goodest Gargoyle

> Level: 1d6 + 2
>
> Form: Small lapel pin of a winged, grinning gargoyle
>
> Effect: Once activated, this gargoyle grows to the size of a human. It follows within a few feet of the user and attacks anyone or anything within immediate range that attacks it or the user. The gargoyle attacks with a powerful blast of water that deals damage equal to its level. The gargoyle lasts for a day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Harrowing Blade Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Long black blade with a carved stone handle

Effect: A successful attack with the blade doesn’t inflict physical damage. Instead, it fills the foe’s mind with dark and dangerous thoughts, inflicting 4 points of Intellect damage (6 points if the artifact Is level 5 or higher) that ignore Armor. The foe does not need to be corporeal for the attack to be successful.

Depletion: —

History’s Fickle Hands

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Watch with a beautiful leather band and silver face whose hands and numbers move in a seemingly random order
>
> Effect: The watch works as a two-way communication device to someone in the past whose level is equal to or less than the artifact level. A screen opens up on the watch face that allows the user to see the person and interact with them. The person isn’t compelled to interact with the user, and the user’s interaction with them doesn’t change anything in the present or future. The connection stays open for ten minutes per artifact level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Keys of Close to You

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Two small gold keys, each with a simple bow

Effect: When activated by two people standing together, the bows of the keys magically adjust to create an abstract representation of the two users’ relationship. At any time, one of the users can teleport themselves to the other person instantly, from up to 50 miles (80 km) away. For this to work, both people must have their key on their person, and there must be no magical barriers in place that are higher level than the artifact.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each teleportation)

Living Copycat

Level: 1d6

Form: Collection of metal magnets in a small tin

Effect: If the user spends about an hour shaping the metal magnets into a copy of a living entity they’ve seen or have an image of, such as a human, cat, or dragon, the living metal takes the shape of that entity (albeit at about a tenth of its size). The copycat does and says everything that the living entity is doing, at the moment that they’re doing it. The copycat lasts for ten minutes per artifact level, after which it returns to a collection of magnets.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Magician’s Protective Amulet

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Silver medallion bearing several magical symbols

Effect: The wearer’s defense rolls against spell attacks are eased (by two steps if the artifact level is 7 or higher).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each spell attack)

Malware Genie

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Thumb drive with the image of a lamp engraved on it

Effect: Inserting the thumb drive into a device produces the avatar of a genie who grants the user a single wish. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish per day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Meatboy

Level: 1d6

Form: Ring with a generic human face design

Effect: The ring creates a “meatboy,” a level 1 lifelike simulation of a human, who appears within immediate range. The meatboy has only a limited vocabulary and ability to reason. It does as the user instructs for one minute, then slumps, melts into reddish goo, and vanishes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

My Friend Lockness

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Silver lapel pin in the shape of the Loch Ness monster

Effect: When activated, the back of the pin opens up to reveal a number of helpful miniature tools, including a lockpick, tweezers, screwdriver, and so on. Using the pin provides an asset in both magical and mundane tasks such as lockpicking and crafting. In addition, it allows the user to perceive items, creatures, spells, and doors that would normally be hidden by easing their perception tasks by two steps (three steps if the cypher is level 7 or higher).

Depletion: 1 in 1d00

Pearls of Your Grandmother, the Witch

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Elegant necklace made of pearls with unusual colors and shapes

Effect: Wearing the necklace eases all crafting tasks (including crafting magic cyphers and artifacts). Tasks that involve finding, sourcing, locating, and purchasing craft-related items are also eased.

Depletion: —

Poor Magician’s Lunchbox

Level: 1d6

Form: Small metal lunchbox with an illustration of a person enjoying a picnic lunch

Effect: The lunchbox creates a set of sturdy compostable utensils and a compostable bowl filled to the brim with a bland-tasting porridge that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (enough for two people if the artifact is level 5 or higher). The porridge is non-allergenic, gluten free, dairy free, meat free, and cruelty free.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Rainbow Suspenders

Level: 1d6

Form: Bright rainbow suspenders that adjust to fit the wearer perfectly

Effect: When worn and visible, the suspenders provide an asset to all positive social interactions. In addition, they provide +1 Armor against Intellect damage.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (roll each interaction); still wearable as regular suspenders after depletion

Ring of Reflected Bullets

Level: 1d6

Form: Red gold ring engraved with a chaotic bullet pattern

Effect: When targeted with a ranged attack from a firearm that fires bullets, the wearer can attempt a hindered Speed defense roll. If the roll succeeds, the bullet rebounds before hitting the wearer and immediately returns to the sender, effectively granting the wearer a free attack against the shooter fired from the shooter’s weapon. The wearer is practiced with this attack.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Scarf of Love and Death

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Hand-knitted scarf with a tag that says MADE WITH LOVE
>
> Effect: When activated, the scarf can do one of two things (chosen by the user). The scarf must be reactivated to switch the effect.
>
> Love: Creates a magical shield around the user for one hour, during which time they gain +2 Armor (+3 Armor if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
>
> Death: For the next hour, each time the user attacks someone in short range, the scarf snaps out in that same action and inflicts 2 additional points of damage (3 points if the artifact is level 5 or higher).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (roll each activation)

Song of the Siren

> Level: 1d6 + 3
>
> Form: Safety whistle in the shape of a woman with bird wings and a fish tail
>
> Effect: Blowing into the whistle creates no sound, but instead causes a siren to appear. The siren sings a brief song. The user chooses a number of targets within long range who can hear it equal to the artifact level. The user makes an Intellect attack against each; affected targets each take 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Speed Readers

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Reading glasses with blue-hued lenses
>
> Effect: Allows the user to quickly read and understand almost anything within short range, such as a book, long article, important document, and so on, even if it’s not in a language they know. Reading something usually takes at least a few rounds, depending on the length of the item.
>
> For the next ten minutes per artifact level, the user remembers everything they read perfectly, and if they take any actions pertaining to that knowledge, their task is eased. At the end of that time, all of their newly gained knowledge disappears. They can only use the speed readers on the same item once.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Tattoo of the Tiger

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tattoo of a nonmagical creature, such as a tiger, spider, domesticated dog, raven, or horse

Effect: Allows the user to shapeshift into the form of the creature depicted in the tattoo. The creature is nearly impossible to tell from other creatures of its ilk, meaning it’s the same size, moves the same way, vocalizes the same way, has the same coloration, and so on. Once shapeshifted, the user can only do things that the creature could do in its normal state, such as run, roar, fly, swim, and so on. They cannot do things as a human would, but they could talk as a raven might talk, use a device as a primate might, and so on. The shapeshifted user otherwise retains their base stats. The form lasts for ten minutes per artifact level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

> Because tattoo artifacts are magical, they can be transferred from one person’s skin to another’s. For example, if a character kills someone with a still-usable tattoo, they can press their skin to the tattoo and it will appear on their body.

Tattoo of Tomorrow’s Edge

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Tattoo of a skull, bones, or other body part with ink made from ashes of the dead

Effect: Each time the user would die, the tattoo brings them back to life and restores 5 points to each of their Pools. However, all of their Pools are permanently reduced by 1 each time.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Tattoo of True Shot

Level: 1d6

Form: Tattoo of a projectile, such as a bullet, arrow, or spear, crafted with ink made with blood

Effect: Adds +1 damage to all of the user’s successful ranged attacks that are made with physical weapons, such as a bow, gun, or throwing knife.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Time is a Circle

> Level: 1d6 + 4
>
> Form: Watch with no face and no hands
>
> Effect: The user can tell the watch what time it is, and it will be that time for them and only them. The watch face shows them a video of what they were experiencing in the past or will experience in the future (depending on what time they chose). The user cannot change anything about the experience, but they can replay and slow down the video. The video lasts for a number of minutes equal to the artifact level and disappears after. Note that while the video of the past is always accurate, the video of the future shows one of many possible futures and may not come true.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (roll each use)

Umbrella of No-Touch

> Level: 1d6 + 3
>
> Form: Umbrella that folds down to the size of a credit card
>
> Effect: When opened, the umbrella grants the user protection from more than just the rain for one minute. Any creature attempting to come within immediate distance of the user stops short and their turn ends if their level is equal to or less than the umbrella’s. PCs gain an Intellect defense roll to overcome the effect.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (roll each use); works as a regular umbrella after depletion

Vanity of the Vanities

> Level: 1d6
>
> Form: Handheld mirror or small vanity with a special button shaped like a crown
>
> Effect: The user activates the artifact by pressing the button and staring into the mirror for one minute. As long as they do some type of personal grooming (such as showering, getting dressed, or applying makeup) within short range of the vanity, no time passes for them, allowing them to spend as much time as they need to get ready.

Depletion: 1 in 1d00 (check each hour of extra time granted to the user); after depletion, its magic stops working but it continues to function as a normal mirror

Witch Wand Level: 1d6

Form: Wooden wand of exceptional quality

Effect: This wand grants its wielder an asset on attack rolls with spells cast while holding it.

Depletion: —

Witch’s Broom

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Long wooden broom

Effect: As a flying vehicle, the broom can be ridden a long distance each round. On extended trips, it can move up to 100 miles (160 km) per hour.

The bearer can call upon the broom to grant them a powerful hallucinogenic state that lasts for four hours, during which time all tasks are hindered. After the hallucinations end, the bearer’s Intellect tasks are eased for the next ten minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Wonder Onesie

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Adult onesie in the form of an animal, imaginary creature, or other entity that adjusts to fit the wearer perfectly.

Effect: When worn, the onesie acts as light armor, but grants an additional +1 Armor (+2 if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 1 Armor that light armor typically provides. Additionally, the user has an asset on all Intellect defense rolls.

Depletion: — (At any time, the GM can rule that the onesie has resisted enough Intellect attacks to deplete that ability, after which it still functions as armor.)

Your Mama’s Biker Jacket

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Well-loved and well-worn leather jacket with the patch of a large winged creature on the back

Effect: When worn, it makes the user appear tough and badass, providing an asset to all interactions involving coercion, persuasion, fear, and intimidation. Roll a d6 to determine the jacket’s secondary ability.

Depletion: — for the main effect, 1 in 1d10 for the secondary ability (check each use)

<table>

| 1-2 | Metal spikes appear along the sleeves, shoulders, and back, providing +1 Armor and +1 damage on unarmed attacks for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.  |
| 3-4 | The wings of the creature emerge from the back of the jacket, allowing the wearer to fly for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. |
| 5-6 | The jacket taunts a foe selected by the wearer within short range for one minute. If the wearer succeeds on an Intellect attack, the foe selectively targets the wearer over other enemies for the duration. The wearer gains an asset on combat tasks, such as attacking and defending, for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.  |

## FANTASY ARTIFACTS

If cyphers are the expendable magic that is ever-present in fantasy, artifacts are the more durable magic items that can be used over and over again—swords, armor, tomes of weird magic, cloaks of invisibility, and so on. Unlike cyphers, there is no limit to how many artifacts a character can bear; an entire campaign might stem from an ongoing quest to collect all of the legendary items carried by a famous hero.

## ARTIFACT RULES

Artifacts are more powerful than common equipment or cyphers. Each artifact has a level and a rate of power depletion. When an artifact is used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows the depletion number(s), the item works, but that is its last use. A depletion entry of “—” means that the artifact never depletes, and an entry of “automatic” means that it can be used only once. Depowered artifacts can sometimes be recharged using the repair rules, depending on the item’s nature. Other special abilities can also repower an expended item, but probably for only one use. Powerful magical creatures might be able to recharge artifacts, at least temporarily

## EXAMPLE FANTASY ARTIFACTS

The rest of this chapter is examples of artifacts suitable for a fantasy game. The artifacts are divided into two tables—one for minor items (artifacts that don’t have particularly flashy or world-affecting abilities) and one for major items (artifacts that do). A GM running a campaign where magic is subtle, weak, or otherwise limited can use the minor items table, and a GM of a campaign where some magic can do powerful or even impossible things can roll on either table.

\* Artifact found in the Fantasy Artifacts section of the Cypher System

## ADAMANTINE ROPE

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: A 50-foot (15 m) length of black rope

Effect: This length of rope has the flexibility of ordinary rope but a hardness greater than steel. It is impervious to damage (including attempts to cut it) from anything less than the artifact’s level.

Depletion: —

## ALCHEMIST BAG

Level: 1d6

Form: Embroidered velvet bag

Effect: This bag can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical potion bottle or scroll case. These cyphers do not count against a character’s cypher limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the bag)

## ARMORED CLOTH

Level: 1d6

Form: Suit of typical clothing (robe, dress, jerkin and breeches, and so on)

Effect: This clothing is soft and flexible, as expected, except when it is struck or crushed with force, at which point it hardens, providing +1 to Armor. It then immediately returns to its normal state (which is in no way encumbering). This clothing cannot be worn with armor of any kind.

Depletion: —

## BELT OF STRENGTH

Level: 1d6

Form: Thick leather belt with a metal buckle and rivets

Effect: The belt enhances the strength and endurance of the wearer. This increases the wearer’s maximum Might Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the belt, any excess Might points above their normal maximum Might Pool are lost; if they wear the belt again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects).

Depletion: —

BOOK OF ALL SPELLS 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes 

Effect: This mysterious spellbook is said to contain knowledge of hundreds of spells—perhaps even all spells. Each set of facing pages includes the magical runes for one spell and a description of the spell and how to use it. 

When a character first opens the book, the GM randomly determines what type of spell is shown by rolling on the following table, then rolling on the indicated table in the Cypher System Reference Document: 

| d6  | Cypher Type                        |
|-----|------------------------------------|
| 1–2 | Roll on the Manifest Cypher table  |
| 3-5 | Roll on the Fantastic Cypher table |
| 6   | Roll on the Subtle Cypher table    |

The bearer can cast the spell on the page as if it were a cypher with a level equal to the book’s level. This doesn’t remove the spell from the page (it can be cast again and again), but it does require a depletion roll. 

As part of another action, the bearer can turn the page to find a new spell, but only forward, never backward. It is said that turning to the last page makes the book vanish and appear somewhere else in the world. 

The artifact always remembers the last page it was turned to. Opening the book always presents that page. Attempting to copy, remove, or destroy a page only makes the book turn to a later page on its own. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (Check each time the book is used or the bearer turns a page. The chance of depletion increases by 1 each time it is used \[1 in 1d100, 2 in 1d100, 3 in 1d100, and so on\]. Instead of depleting, the book might turn to a later page, or disappear and reappear somewhere else in the world.)

BOUNDING BOOTS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Sturdy but flexible boots 

Effect: The boots assist the wearer’s every step to make jumping and running easier. The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

CAT’S EYE SPECTACLES 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Pair of dark crystalline spectacles in a dull wooden frame 

Effect: Outside, the wearer can see at night as if it were daylight. Inside, the wearer can see in pitch darkness up to short range (or to long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

CLOAK OF BALAKAR 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Blue cloak with elaborate designs suggesting blowing wind 

Effect: The wearer can calm winds of the artifact’s level or lower in a radius of 1 mile (1.5 km). Up to once a day, the wearer can create a destructive windstorm up to that size, lasting one minute; this storm’s level is equal to half the artifact’s level. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (on depletion, cloak disappears and reappears somewhere else in the world) 

CLOAK OF ELFKIND 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Thin greyish-green cloak with a cowl and clasp 

Effect: When activated (by drawing the hood over the wearer’s head), the cloak takes on the colors and textures of everything around the wearer for ten minutes (or one hour if the artifact is level 8 or higher). This eases hiding and sneaking tasks by two steps. While the cloak is activated, the wearer can also see in the dark. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CLOAK OF FINERY 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Multilayered cloak of glittering material 

Effect: This cloak is woven of beautiful fibers and set with dazzling gems. It automatically fits itself to its wearer in the most flattering way. When activated, it enhances the wearer’s appearance, voice, tone, and even their grammar, granting an asset to all interaction tasks for the next minute. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

COIL OF ENDLESS ROPE 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Coil of rope 

Effect: The coil of rope can be let out at a rate of 50 feet (15 m) per round; however, no end to the rope can be found no matter how long the user uncoils it. The rope retains its incredible length until recoiled or until it becomes depleted. If cut, any length beyond the coil’s initial 50 feet crumbles into powder after a round or two. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each use that extends it beyond 50 feet) 

CROWN OF EYES 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Metallic circlet set with several crystal spheres 

Effect: It takes one round to activate the crown. When activated, the crystal spheres separate from the crown and fly around the wearer at immediate range for an hour. The wearer can see anything the crystal spheres can see. This allows the wearer to peek around corners without being exposed to danger. This gives the wearer an asset in initiative and all perception tasks. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

CROWN OF THE MIND 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Crown, circlet, headband, diadem, or amulet 

Effect: The crown augments the mind and thoughts of the wearer. This increases the wearer’s maximum Intellect Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the crown, any excess Intellect points above their normal maximum Intellect Pool are lost; if they wear the crown again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects). 

Depletion: — 

CRYSTAL BALL 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Melon-sized crystalline or glass orb, with or without a support stand 

Effect: This allows the user to scry (view) remote locations and creatures. The user must make a difficulty 2 Intellect task to activate the crystal ball, then use an action trying to make it show a person or location they know. The user must succeed at an Intellect task against the level of the target; otherwise, the crystal shows only indistinct or misleading images. The task roll is modified by how familiar the target is to the user, how available they are to be viewed, and how far away they are.

| Familiarity                      |          |
|----------------------------------|----------|
| Only have name or description    | Hindered |
| Target has been visited          | Eased    |
| Target is well known to the user | Eased    |
| Availability                     |          |
| Target is willing                | Eased    |
| Target is unwilling              | Hindered |
| Distance                         |          |
| More than 1 mile                 | Hindered |
| More than 10 miles               | Hindered |
| More than 100 miles              | Hindered |

These modifiers are cumulative, so trying to view a level 4 target who the user knows only by name (+1 step), is unwilling (+1 step), and is 20 miles away (+2 steps) is a difficulty 8 task.

 The crystal shows the creature or area for one minute before the image becomes muddled and the artifact must be activated again. 

In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to apply a level of Effort to open two-way communication with the viewed area. All creatures in the area can sense the user’s presence and hear their voice, and the creatures can speak to and be heard by the user. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

An unwilling creature’s defenses against magic and Intellect attacks should hinder scrying attempts just as they would against a directly harmful mental spell.

DEATH’S SCYTHE 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Double-handed scythe 

Effect: This scythe functions as a heavy weapon. In addition, it instantly kills level 1 or level 2 creatures it hits. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to use a level of Effort to affect a higher-level target; each level of Effort applied increases the level of creature that can be instantly killed by the scythe. Thus, to instantly kill a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), the wielder must apply three levels of Effort. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check per killing effect; upon depletion, a manifestation of Death appears to reclaim its blade)

Death manifestation: level 7

DEMONFLESH 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Ball of black leather with vein-like red streaks 

Effect: When activated, the ball liquefies and coats the body of the user for one hour, appearing to be a form-fitting leather suit veined with pathways of dully glowing blood. As an action, the wearer can become invisible. While invisible, they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if they do something to reveal their presence or position—attacking, casting a spell, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, they can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding their position. The wearer can inflict 3 points of damage with a touch by releasing a dark crackle of demonic power. This attack ignores most Armor, but Armor made to ward against evil or demonic attacks should work against it. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

To randomly determine what kind of dragontongue weapon is found, see Chapter 4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34.

DEMONIC RUNE BLADE 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Sword inscribed with demonic runes 

Effect: This longsword functions as a medium weapon, but it is actually a powerful demon transformed into the shape of a sword. The demon cannot speak directly to the wielder, but it can make its desires known by emitting bass rumbles and dirgelike melodies, and by pulling in the direction of its desire. The sword eases all attacks made with it by one step, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (for a total of 8 points). 

If the wielder kills a creature with the sword, the sword eats the creature’s spirit and transfers some of its energy to the wielder, adding 5 points to their Might Pool and increasing their Might Edge by 1. This lasts for an hour and allows the wielder to exceed their normal Might Pool and Might Edge stats.

If the wielder misses with an attack, the blade sometimes hits an ally of the wielder instead (this always happens on an attack roll of 1). 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check each time a killed creature’s life force is absorbed; if depleted, the sword’s magical abilities can be recharged if it kills an “innocent” creature) 

DRAGONTONGUE WEAPON 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Weapon that roars with red flame when activated, trailing a stream of black smoke

Effect: This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its type. If the wielder uses it to attack a foe, upon a successful hit, the wielder decides whether to activate the flame. Upon activation, the weapon lashes the target with fire, inflicting additional points of damage equal to the artifact level. The effect lasts for one minute after each activation. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

DRAGONTOOTH SOLDIERS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Burlap bag containing a handful of large reptilian teeth

 Effect: If a tooth is drawn from the bag and cast upon the earth, a dragontooth warrior appears, ready to fight for the user for up to ten minutes before going their own way. The user can draw several teeth at once from the bag, but each tooth drawn requires a separate depletion roll. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

Dragontooth warrior: level equal to the artifact level, Speed defense as artifact level + 1 due to shield; Armor 1; spear attack (melee or short range) inflicts damage and impedes movement of victim to immediate range for one round

ELFBLADE 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Medium sword

Effect: This sword can be used as a normal medium sword that deals 2 additional points of damage (for a total of 6 points). The short sword can cut through any material of its level or lower with ease, owing to its exceptional sharpness. The blade sheds a blue light as bright as a candle to warn when goblins, orcs, trolls, or similar creatures are within 300 feet (90 m). Depletion: — 

## ENCHANTED ARMOR L

evel: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor 

Effect: This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor (or +2 if the artifact is level 7 or higher) beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so enchanted chainmail provides a total of 3 Armor (for artifact level 6 or lower) or 4 Armor (for artifact level 7 or higher). 

The additional Armor provided by the magic also applies to damage that often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage). 

Depletion: —

EXPLODING ARROW 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Arrow with runes carved on the shaft and head 

Effect: The arrow explodes when it strikes something, inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range. Roll d100 to determine the type of damage.

| 01-20 | Acid                           |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| 21-40 | Electricity                    |
| 41-60 | Cold                           |
| 61-90 | Fire                           |
| 91-00 | Necromantic (harms only flesh) |

Depletion: Automatic 

One advantage of an exploding arrow over a detonation cypher is that the arrow doesn’t count toward your cypher limit. 

An exploding arrow can instead be a crossbow bolt, sling stone, or other thrown weapon or projectile.

EXPLORER’S GLOVES 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Thick but flexible-fingered leather gloves 

Effect: The wearer can cling to or climb any surface for up to one hour. Even level 10 climbing tasks become routine while the gloves are activated, but taking any other action while climbing requires a new activation. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

 FALCON CLOAK

Level: 1d6 

Form: Cloak made of feathers 

Effect: For ten hours, the wearer becomes a falcon whose level is equal to the artifact level. The falcon can fly a long distance each round, or up to 60 miles (97 km) per hour when traveling overland. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Most magic items that turn a character into a different creature make it difficult to use any of the character’s special abilities (other than skills) in that form.

## FLYING CARPET

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Silken rug with repeating designs bordered with a pattern that suggests scudding clouds 

Effect: The carpet flies a long distance each round, carrying up to five passengers. It flies for up to ten hours per activation. When traveling overland, the artifact can achieve a flying speed of 60 miles (97 km) per hour. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

GHOSTLY ARMOR 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor 

Effect: This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so ghostly chainmail provides 3 Armor. 

When activated, the armor randomly makes the wearer ghostly and immaterial for ten minutes (or for one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps without hindering any of the character’s abilities. Special multidimensional weapons or attacks (such as abilities meant to harm ghosts) ignore this defense. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (for the ghostly defense ability, but after depletion, the suit still functions as normal armor and provides its full Armor value)

To randomly determine what kind of ghostly armor is found, see Chapter 4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34. 

GLOVES OF AGILITY 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Supple leather or cloth gloves 

Effect: The gloves enhance the dexterity and reflexes of the wearer. This increases the wearer’s maximum Speed Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the gloves, any excess Speed points above their normal maximum Speed Pool are lost; if they wear the gloves again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects). 

Depletion: — 

GRUELMAKER 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Clay bowl stamped with symbols of fish and birds 

Effect: The bowl fills itself to the brim with a bland-tasting tan porridge that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (or two people if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

GUARDIAN IDOL 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Demonic idol on top of a thin metal leg that is 1 foot (30 cm) tall 

Effect: It takes two rounds to balance this artifact on its metal leg, and then it requires an action to activate. When activated, the idol stares at the activating character and nearby creatures for five rounds, memorizing their faces and shapes. After that, if anything the idol doesn’t recognize (and is larger than a mouse) comes within long range, it spits a small ball of fire at the target. The fire inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The idol can attack up to ten times per round, but it never attacks the same target more than once per round. It remains on watch for twenty-four hours or until it has made one hundred attacks, whichever comes first.  
Depletion: Automatic

HAND OF GLORY 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Dried humanoid hand with candle-tip fingers 

Effect: A hand of glory has several potential uses, including the following. In all cases, the candles making up the hand must be lit and burning to produce an effect. Insensibility: A target within short range is held motionless and unable to take actions as long as the lit hand remains within range (or until the target is attacked or otherwise snapped out of the trance). Invisibility: User is invisible for up to one minute while holding the hand. While invisible, the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. Thief ’s Passage: A locked or barred door or a container whose level is less than or equal to the hand’s level becomes unlocked when touched by the hand. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

HELM OF WATER BREATHING 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Green metal helm with a scaly or fishy motif Effect: The wearer’s head is enveloped in a tight bubble of air that constantly renews itself, allowing them to breathe underwater indefinitely, speak normally, and so on. 

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100 (check each day) 

HORN OF THUNDER 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Large signal horn banded with metal and carved with runes 

Effect: This massive instrument can barely be held or carried by a single person. When activated, it emits a 50-foot (15 m) wide cone of pure sonic force out to long range. Any creature in that area is knocked prone and stunned for one round, losing its action. Unfixed items the size of a human or smaller are toppled and/or moved at least 5 feet (1.5 m). Larger objects might also be toppled. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

INSTANT LADDER 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Small lightweight metal rod with gem buttons 

Effect: When activated, the rod extends and produces rungs so that it can be used as a ladder up to 28 feet (9 m) long. The ladder can be transformed back into its rod form from either end. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

A creature unfamiliar with the buttons on an instant ladder needs to spend several rounds figuring out the proper sequence to expand or collapse it.

LIGHTNING HAMMER 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Massive silver hammer that crackles with electricity 

Effect: This hammer functions as a normal heavy weapon. However, if the wielder uses an action to activate it, the weapon radiates electricity for one round. If used to attack on the next round, the hammer inflicts an additional 10 points of electricity damage. The user can choose to strike the ground instead, sending shockwaves of electricity outward that deal 5 points of damage to everyone within short range. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (still usable as a normal heavy weapon after depletion)

MASTERCRAFT ARMOR 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Armor of exceptional quality 

Effect: This armor grants its wearer an asset for Speed defense rolls. 

Depletion: — 

MASTERCRAFT WEAPON 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Weapon of exceptional quality 

Effect: This weapon grants its wielder an asset for attack rolls made with it. 

Depletion: — 

Depending on the game world, mastercraft armor and weapons might be magical, mundanely crafted with exceptional quality, or both. To randomly determine what kind of mastercraft armor or weapon is found, see Chapter 4: Medieval Fantasy Equipment, page 34.

MINDSHIELD HELMET 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Lightweight cloth, leather, or metal helmet 

Effect: The wearer gains 3 Armor that protects against Intellect damage only. Further, attempts to affect the wearer’s mind are hindered (or hindered by two steps if the artifact is level 7 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

NECROMANTIC WAND 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Bone wand carved with runes 

Effect: This wand emits a faint short-range beam of sickly violet light that affects only organic creatures and materials. Living targets hit by the beam move one step down the damage track. Nonliving organic targets are likely destroyed. 

This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each “round of ammo” used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

PACK OF STORAGE 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Leather backpack or haversack with multiple pockets

Effect: This pack’s mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2 m) in diameter. It is larger on the inside than on the outside, and can carry up to 500 pounds (226 kg) or 10 cubic feet (.3 cubic m). The pack weighs about one-tenth as much as it is holding. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack; on depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack) 

POISONER’S TOUCH 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Very thin transparent glove with faint markings

Effect: When the wearer activates the glove (which might require speaking a command word or tracing a specific pattern on its surface), it secretes a small amount of poison. The next creature the wearer touches with the glove takes Speed damage equal to the artifact level (ignores Armor) and must make a new Might defense roll each round or suffer the damage again until either they succeed at the defense roll or five rounds pass, whichever comes first. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

PROTECTION AMULET 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Stylized amulet worn on a chain 

Effect: The amulet reduces one type of damage by an amount equal to the artifact level. Roll a d20 to determine the kind of damage the amulet protects against.

| 1-4   | Acid        |
|-------|-------------|
| 5-8   | Cold        |
| 9-12  | Electricity |
| 13-16 | Fire        |
| 17-20 | Poison      |

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each time the amulet reduces damage)

RING OF FALL FLOURISHING 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Gold band inscribed with feather wreath 

Effect: The wearer of the ring can fall any distance safely, landing easily and upright. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

RING OF INVISIBILITY 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Gold band inscribed with characters that are revealed only if ring is heated 

Effect: The wearer of the ring becomes invisible for one minute. While invisible, the wearer is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. The effect ends if they attack or spend points from a Pool for any reason. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

RING OF WISHES 

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Plain gold band 

Effect: The user makes a wish, and it is granted, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the artifact, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect accordingly. (The larger the wish, the more likely the GM will limit its effect.) 

Depletion: 1–3 in 1d6 

SHIELD OF TWO SKIES 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Small hexagonal amulet 

Effect: Upon activation, the amulet creates a faint glow around the wearer that provides +2 to Armor against heat and cold (or +3 for artifact level 6 and higher). The effect lasts for ten minutes. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

## SKILL RING

Level: 1d6 

Form: Ring carved with sigils appropriate to its granted skill 

Effect: This ring grants its wearer knowledge of a specific skill, such as climbing, jumping, history, or persuasion. This grants the wearer training in that skill (or in two skills if the artifact is level 5 or higher). 

Depletion: — 

SMOOTH-STEPPING BOOTS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Pair of boots 

Effect: When the boots are activated, for the next hour the wearer can move across rough or difficult terrain at normal speed, walk up walls, and even walk across liquids. In areas of low or no gravity, the wearer can walk along hard surfaces (even vertically or upside down) as if under normal gravity. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

SOUL-STEALING KNIFE 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Night-black blade in which distant stars are sometimes visible 

Effect: This knife functions as a normal light weapon. However, if the wielder wishes, on a successful attack, it inflicts additional damage (ignores Armor) equal to the artifact’s level. If damage from the dagger reduces a target to 0 health, the target’s soul is drawn into the blade. The soul remains trapped there for up to three days, after which time it is consumed. (Alternatively, the wielder can release the soul to whatever its fate would otherwise be.) 

As a separate activation, the wielder can ask three questions of a creature whose soul is trapped in the blade and not yet consumed. After answering the third question, the soul is consumed. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each activation)

SOVEREIGN KEY 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Slender golden key 

Effect: When touched to a lock or the surface of a sealed object (such as a chest, envelope, or urn), the key briefly glows and attempts to open the target. Sealed objects fall open like peeled fruits if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level, and locks open easily if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 

SPELLBOOK OF ELEMENTAL SUMMONING 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes 

Effect: When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level 3 Intellect task, they can summon an elemental of one specific kind described in the book (earth, fire, thorn, or some other type). The elemental appears and does the summoner’s bidding for up to one hour, unless it somehow breaks the geas created by the book. 

Depletion: 1–3 in 1d20

STAFF OF BLACK IRON 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Staff of black iron set with an eye-shaped crystal headpiece 

Effect: The wielder can use an action to gain one of the following effects. 

Influence: The wielder makes a mental attack on a creature within immediate range by providing a suggestion. An affected target follows any suggestion during its next turn that doesn’t cause direct harm to itself or its allies. 

Lightning: The wielder discharges a bolt of lightning that attacks all targets along a straight line out to long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level. 

Shield: For one hour, the wielder gains the protective effect of using a normal shield (an asset on their Speed defense rolls). This effect is invisible and doesn’t require them to hold a shield; merely touching the staff is sufficient. 

The staff can have more than one effect ongoing at a time (such as using the shield ability and blasting someone with lightning), but each requires a separate activation and depletion roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 

## STAFF OF HEALING

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Wooden staff capped with a golden icon 

Effect: The staff emits a short-range beam of silvery light that affects only living creatures. A living creature hit by the beam moves up one step on the damage track. A target that is not down on the damage track can immediately make a free recovery roll (or, for NPCs, regain a number of points of health equal to three times their level). 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

STAFF OF THE PROPHET 

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Short wooden staff 

Effect: The staff has three abilities, each of which requires an action to activate. 

Sea Passage. Creates a dry route through a body of water. The route is approximately 20 feet (6 m) wide, up to 1,000 feet (300 m) deep, and as long as the body of water is wide. The path remains open for up to four hours, or the wielder can collapse it as an action. 

Snake Form. Staff transforms into a venomous snake whose level is equal to the artifact level. The snake has a bite attack that inflicts 6 points of damage, plus 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll. The snake obeys the wielder’s verbal commands, but it can’t do anything a regular snake couldn’t do.  
Water From Stone. Produces approximately 10 gallons (38 liters) of pure water within immediate range, as if from a natural spring in the ground. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

STORM SHACK 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Miniature model of a simple wooden shack 

Effect: Activating the artifact transforms it over the next few rounds into a simple wooden shack that is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) with a thin door. Everything inside the area of the full-size shack is protected from most forms of inclement weather for one hour (or ten hours for artifact level 6 and higher). Leaving or entering the shack before the duration is up makes it harmlessly collapse upon itself unless the character succeeds on a Speed roll against the artifact’s level. If collapsed early or the duration runs out, the shack collapses into sticks, dust, and the miniature model, which can be taken and reused. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

TRAP RUNESTONE 

Level: 1d6 

Form: Pouch with chalk, sealing wax, and an engraved runestone 

Effect: A simple cypher (such as a potion or scroll) can be modified with this set of implements to turn it into a trap. First, the cypher is attached to a surface with the sealing wax, then the user must make a difficulty 4 Intellect task to draw the runestone symbols around the edge of the cypher with the chalk and place the runestone in the correct position. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people often use straightforward cyphers such as an explosive spell scroll, a poisonous potion, and so on. 

The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)—a door opening, a creature or object moving past the runestone, and so on. The higher the level of the artifact, the more sophisticated the trigger. For example, a level 4 artifact’s trigger might be based on a creature’s size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a specific type of creature, and a level 6 artifact can trigger based on recognizing an individual creature. 

Depletion: Automatic 

TUNNELING GAUNTLETS 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Oversized pair of metallic gauntlets with broad nails 

Effect: When activated, for one hour the gauntlets let the wearer burrow up to an immediate distance each round. They can burrow through most soils and even some stone, but only through material whose level is lower than the artifact level. Burrowing leaves behind a tunnel with a diameter of 5 feet (1.5 m) that remains stable for several hours. After that, the tunnel is subject to collapse. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

VORPAL SWORD 

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Long sword that sometimes whispers and snickers aloud 

Effect: The vorpal sword cuts through any material of a level lower than its own. It is a medium weapon that ignores Armor of a level lower than its own. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, the suggested minor or major effect is decapitation if the artifact is higher level than the foe (use this only if the foe has a head; otherwise, choose a different effect). 

Depletion: 1–2 in 1d100 (check each decapitation and specific attempt to cut through solid material) 

WAND OF SPIDER’S WEBBING 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: White oak wand 

Effect: This wand produces a long-range stream of grey spider’s webbing that entangles a target and holds it stuck to nearby surfaces. Entangled victims can’t move or take actions that require movement. Targets whose level is higher than the wand’s level can usually break free within one or two rounds. The entangling web is highly flammable, and if ignited it burns away over the course of one round, but the intense heat inflicts damage equal to the artifact level on whatever was caught within it. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

WHISPERER IN THE ETHER 

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: Small crystal 

Effect: The bearer of this crystal can telepathically communicate with an immortal being whose location is unknown (probably another dimension or a godly or infernal realm). The user can converse with the intelligence on an ongoing basis, but in general, the whisperer can share a useful bit of information, insight, or advice about once every day. Sometimes, this translates into an asset on one of the user’s actions. For example, the intelligence can suggest the right phrase to make friends with a shopkeeper to get a good deal, the right tools to use while trying to break open a door, or the right place to put a shield to deflect an incoming attack. Sometimes the information is more broad, such as the right road to take to reach the next town or why a group of monsters is attacking the caravan the bearer is guarding. 

The whisperer’s willingness and ability to converse varies considerably. Sometimes it is quite chatty and offers advice. Other times, it must be convinced, cajoled, or tricked into giving information. And sometimes, it is entirely absent for reasons it will not explain. The whisperer’s knowledge base is broad but not omniscient. It cannot see the future, but it can often predict outcomes based on logic. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day)

WITCH’S BROOM

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: A 6-foot (2 m) long wooden broom 

Effect: As a vehicle, the broom can be ridden a long distance each round. On extended trips, it can move up to 100 miles (160 km) per hour. 

The bearer can call upon the broom to grant them a powerful hallucinogenic state that lasts for four hours, during which time all tasks are hindered. After the hallucinations end, the bearer’s Intellect tasks are eased for the next ten minutes. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

## SCIENCE FICTION ARTIFACTS

## DARKEST BOOK

Level: 10

Form: Large, metal-bound book

Effect: Fashioned by the primordial entity who created evil magic, the Darkest Book is

a record of every vile incantation, curse, and ritual ever performed. It is known to include spells that create werewolves, raise an army of zombies, revive a dead body as a vampire, conjure demons and devils, and release profane energy for various effects. It eases by three steps any task related to magical lore.

Even someone unskilled at magic can open it to a random page and read the spell there (the GM randomly determines the spell by rolling on the Fantastic Cypher table), which takes effect at level 10.

The Darkest Book is somewhat sentient and can hide its words from anyone it doesn’t want reading it. It might require a person casting a spell from it to succeed at a difficulty 6 Intellect defense roll or take 6 points of Intellect damage and move one step down the damage track.

The book is technically indestructible; anything strong enough to destroy an object of its level merely destroys one of its pages, and the book can’t be destroyed as long as at least one page remains.

## OMNI ORB

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Glowing, orb-shaped technological device Effect: The user holding the orb imagines

what they want to happen (similar to using a magical wish), and it happens, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the orb, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect accordingly. (The larger the desired effect, the more likely the GM will limit

it.) Activating the omni orb automatically moves the character using it one step down the damage track.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (instead of depleting, a roll of 1 means the user experiences a GM intrusion related to the effect they created)

A benchmark for setting an omni orb’s limits is to compare it to a cypher of the orb’s level—if there is a cypher that can do what the PC wants, and that cypher is equal to or less than the orb’s level, it works. For example, if a team of superheroes tries to use a level 5 orb to teleport to their base 100 miles away, the GM can look at the list of cyphers and see that a teleporter (traveler) cypher can transport one character up to 100 miles per cypher level, so transporting a group of PCs 100 miles is probably within the orb’s power

## SPACE RING

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Metal ring with a star insignia

Effect: The wearer is able to fly as effortlessly as walking, moving up to a short distance each round in any direction. In space, if the wearer does nothing but move for three actions in a row, they accelerate greatly and can move up to 200 miles (320 km) per hour, or about 2,000 feet (600 m) each round. The ring also provides the wearer with breathable air while in space or underwater (although this doesn’t provide protection against poison gas or other air-based hazards). The wearer can verbally communicate with other ring-wearers within 1 mile (1.5 km), and verbally request information (relayed to them with a synthesized voice) from the internet or a local equivalent.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each day of flying)

Equipment and Weapons as Artifacts

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially be any one of the items presented in this chapter, if found by characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said, even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially unusual devices are everywhere. 

Dimensional Modulator

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Marble-sized crisscross shape of unknown material 

Effect: A target within immediate range loses their dimension of breadth (which folds into a higher dimension), rendering them as flat as paper. The target adheres to whatever surface it was attached to, set upon, or was standing upon, and resembles particularly realistic art. An affected creature enters stasis. While in stasis, it is unable to take actions, doesn’t age, and is immune to damage and effects. It remains in stasis for about a day, until the user returns the missing dimension or the artifact depletes. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Metabolic Prod

Level: 1d6 + 1 

Form: 1 m (4 foot) metallic rod of unknown material 

Effect: When touched to a living target (possibly as an attack), the rod injects a potent cocktail of engineered biomolecules, paralyzing the target for up to one minute. The rod wielder may also choose one of the following additional effects, if set before attacking. 

Aggression: The target’s aggressive tendencies are increased for one hour, during which time the target attacks almost anything it encounters. 

Calm: The target’s aggressive tendencies are tamped down for one hour, during which time the target responds to attacks but never initiates them. 

Hibernation: The target falls into hibernation, a coma-like sleep in which their metabolism slows to a crawl. They can go months with no additional food or water and with a fraction of the air they’d normally need. Loud sounds, damage, persistent prodding, and the like wakes someone in hibernation. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Probability Regulator

Level: 1d6 + 4 

Form: Fist-sized mathematically perfect solid of constant width of unknown material 

Effect: For tasks that are usually random, the user exerts some level of control. When picking a card, rolling a die, choosing a number, or otherwise taking an action that skill usually plays no part in, they attempt an Intellect task whose difficulty is determined by how unlikely choosing correctly might be, so long as it is possible, even if unlikely. A 50/50 coin flip is a difficulty of 1, whereas picking a series of numbers with odds around 1 in 300,000,000 is difficulty 10. If successful, they achieve the desired result. 

Depletion: 1 × task difficulty in 1d20

Steorraform

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Badge-sized seven-pointed star of unknown material 

Effect: If the wearer would become debilitated or die, the worn steorraform prevents it by instantly restoring health (to a creature or an NPC) or points to a Pool (to a player character). If the wearer would die of old age, disease, or poison, the artifact prevents it by rolling back the clock by a few decades, clearing the disease, or denaturing the poison. The artifact is ineffective in preventing death when those conditions last over several rounds or more, such as falling into lava, the sun, a singularity, and so on. 

Depletion: 1 × number of previous uses in 1d20

## WEAPONS

Artifacts that can be used as weapons, though some have other uses as well. 

Light, Medium, and Heavy Artifact Weapons: The artifact weapons described in this section are idiosyncratic in that they are not described as light, medium, or heavy. If they were specifically categorized, many characters would find that their training doesn’t match up with a particular designation. With artifact weapons living outside the regular weapon categories, anyone can use an artifact weapon.

Alpha Beam Projector

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Rifle-like device of unknown material 

Effect: The device has two settings. One fires a beam of energy that acts as propulsion and rockets the artifact away unless the user can hold onto it as a difficulty 1 Might-based task. A user could use this setting to fly a long distance each round, but doing so requires a difficulty 4 Speed-based task each round to move in the direction desired (and not plow into the ground or the side of a building). The other setting fires a reactionless beam that can be used as a very long-range plasma attack that inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The beam ignores 1 point of Armor from the target. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Carbonizer

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Pistol-like device of unknown material 

Effect: This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Death Ray

Level: 1d6 + 3 

Form: Pistol-like device of unknown material 

Effect: This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Disintegration Beamer

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Rifle-like device with two electrodelike protrusions of unknown material 

Effect: This device fires a beam to suppress the charge of the electrons that make up a creature or object within long range, inflicting damage equal to twice the artifact’s level. If the attack reduces the target’s health (or combined Pools for a PC) to below the level of the artifact, the target instantly falls to dust. (A PC who would be disintegrated can spend 1 XP and instead descend one step on the damage track.) 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Empathetic Ray

Level: 1d6 + 2 

Form: Rod-like device with very long barrel of unknown material 

Effect: This device emits an invisible beam of neural-magnetic energy as a short-range attack that instantly reverses how a level 1 target sees the user (turning an enemy into a friend, and vice versa) for up to one day. The user can adjust the settings to increase the ray’s effectiveness by making one additional depletion roll per increase in the maximum level of the target. Thus, to alter the attitude of level 5 target (4 levels above the normal limit), the user must make five depletion rolls. If used against a PC, an affected PC can attempt an Intellect task to end the effect once every minute for the first few minutes, then once every hour. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

HORROR ARTIFACTS 

Most Cypher System artifacts in a horror setting are either cursed objects (which draw or focus

the attention of monsters on a place or person) or things used to control, contain, or destroy the horrors threatening the main characters. The origin of the artifact is often part of the backstory of the plot: why a particular ghost is haunting the house, why the cultists are making human sacrifices, or why monsters keep appearing in a particular town. In most cases, the characters don’t have to know how these things work, how they were made, or what sort of creature (alien, demon, ghost) is responsible—an artifact is merely a tool that gives the PCs a chance to survive the threat, or the thing that must be destroyed to make everything safe again (see the Bad Penny module).

Because one of the interesting aspects of horror is mixing genres, you should feel free to incorporate any of these artifacts into your horror game even if they’re traditionally associated with different genres; it’ll give your game a unique twist and give you many additional ways to scare the PCs and players. For example, PCs entering the lair of a vampire might find a room with a dozen brain cylinders, each containing the brain of a former lover or would-be hunter, forever imprisoned and available for conversation whenever the vampire wants it. Or PCs dealing with an alien invasion find the crashed spacecraft and discover that its engine is connected to a ghost vault, using the souls of the dead as a power source for interstellar travel.

> The Bad Penny module is a handy GM tool when a horror artifact is important to the game’s plot.

## LOVECRAFTIAN ARTIFACTS  
The stories of the mythos often feature strange books or devices (which might be magical or of

exotic scientific manufacture) that are connected to the plot and often reference or have links to each other. Even if your Lovecraftian game session doesn’t involve these artifacts, having other characters mention them or letting the PCs find notes about them creates a sense of a larger world filled with unknowable horrors. Appropriate items in this chapter are:

• Brain cylinder

• Necronomicon

• Pnakotic Manuscripts 

• Shining trapezohedron

HORROR ARTIFACTS 

## BOOK OF THOTH

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bundle of Ancient Egyptian scrolls

Effect: This Egyptian funerary text is thought to have been authored by Thoth himself, the wisest of the Egyptian gods. It usually contains several spells, but its greatest power is a ritual that can revive a mummy (whether an inert mummy or an animate undead one) as a living immortal human being. The ritual requires an intact mummy, its canopic jars (or suitable replacements), and a human sacrifice whose level is equal to the target mummy’s level. The ritual takes one hour to perform and costs Might, Speed, and Intellect points equal to the target mummy’s level.

Depletion: —

## BRAIN CYLINDER

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Metal cylinder with three exterior ports

Effect: This device is designed to hold and preserve an intelligent brain, keeping it alive indefinitely. The brain must first be surgically extracted from its natural housing (typically

a level 6 surgical task requiring an hour), then placed in the cylinder, saturated with a nutrient bath, and sealed shut. The brain is wired to three ports on the cylinder’s exterior, which can be connected to external machines that allow it to see and hear, as well as speak through a voice synthesizer. The cylinder is immune to vacuum and cold, allowing it to be carried through space without harming its precious contents. The cylinder grants the brain 3 Armor, but

the brain is otherwise helpless, unable to perform physical actions, and completely blind and deaf if disconnected from its machines. Deprived of the illusion of physical stimuli, a human brain trapped in a cylinder is likely to go insane after weeks or months.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each year)

Some brain cylinders were created by the mi-go; others are the products of mad scientists or other alien species that want to study humans.

## CURSED VIDEO

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: DVD, film, thumb drive, or videocassette

Effect: Anyone who watches this disturbing video must make an Intellect defense roll against the level of the artifact or become cursed. A cursed victim becomes haunted by a malevolent spirit and begins to experience strange phenomena, which eventually kills them. The curse can simultaneously affect a number of people equal to the artifact level (which prevents it from starting a curse epidemic by being broadcast or posted online where thousands of people can see it at once).

For some cursed videos, a victim can free themselves of the curse by making another person watch the video, thus passing the curse on to a new victim.

Depletion: —

## DEMON PUZZLE

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Crystal or device

Effect: Solving the puzzle creates a beacon or portal that draws a demon (or other extradimensional entity) to the user’s location. The demon’s level is equal to the artifact’s level. Depending on the intent of the puzzle’s creator and the nature of the demon summoned, the demon might perform a service for the user, attack the user, try to drag the user back to its home dimension, or leave to do whatever it wants. (Solving the puzzle is part of the action of activating the artifact and doesn’t require a roll, as it wants to be solved this way.) Instead of using the artifact to summon a demon, the user can attempt to solve the puzzle in a different way, which forces a demon back to its native dimension. The user must make an Intellect roll with a difficulty equal to the artifact’s level. If successful, the user banishes a demon within short range whose level is lower than the artifact’s level.

There are similar artifacts that instead summon or banish ghosts, Lovecraftian horrors, or other strange creatures, with similar risks.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

## GHOST VAULT

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Large immobile machine Effect: When used in conjunction with a ghost trap, this machine can imprison multiple ghosts (including spirits, phased beings, and similar creatures) for an indefinite amount of time. The total level of ghosts it can store is equal to its level × 20 (so a level 5 vault can hold 100 levels of ghosts). The vault can be used as a ghost trap, but doing so triggers a depletion roll. If the vault is disconnected from its power supply, destroyed, or depletes, the imprisoned ghosts are freed, initially at a rate of one per round but quickly speeding up so that all of them are free within a couple of minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each month)

## HUMAN SUIT

Level: 1d6

Form: Folds of cloth and fleshlike substance (inactive) or a specific human individual (active)

Effect: The wearer of a human suit is completely disguised as a specific human individual; their disguise task to pretend to be that human is eased by five steps. A human suit is usually no one in particular; each suit is designed to allow the wearer to adopt a new human persona, not pretend to be someone famous. A suit’s technology is such that it adapts to fit a wearer ranging from half the size of a normal human to one that is almost the same size (including another human). Human suits usually come with attached clothing.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

MONKEY’S PAW

Level: 1d6

Form: Mummified monkey’s paw

Effect: This cursed object will grant three wishes to the user, but each wish always has terrible consequences. A wish for wealth might mean a friend dies and leaves the user some money in a will. A wish for a dead person to return to life might turn them into a zombie. A wish for knowledge might grant specialization in one subject but inabilities in all others. No matter how clever the user thinks they are or how precisely they word their wish, the result is always fulfilled in a way that makes them regret using the artifact. The monkey’s paw is limited to affecting things of its level or lower. For example, a level 3 monkey’s paw could be used to wish for the death of a level 3 enemy, destroy a level 3 barrier, resurrect a dead level 3

person, and so on. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

## NECRONOMICON (LOVECRAFTIAN, LATIN EDITION)

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Grimoire (no reader can long keep the book’s exact form in memory) 

Effect: A reader who understands Latin can use this grimoire to accomplish a wide variety of occult operations, all of which risk their sanity. Indeed, one must be a little insane or at least naive to use this tome, given its storied history. That said, the uses a reader can put the Necronomicon to include the following.

• Reference. The grimoire eases by three steps any task related to knowledge of Lovecraftian realms, entities, objects, and related subjects.

• Spellbook. The grimoire contains a variety of horrifying spells and rituals, which a reader can attempt to cast by incanting from the tome. They range from simple curses and spells to speak to the dead all the way up to death spells and the summoning of Lovecraftian entities. The GM can let the player describe the kind of spell desired, and then decide if it exists in the Necronomicon. If it does, the spell also likely has an unintended side effect, such as infecting a nearby object or friend with a demonic entity, killing a pet, or driving a nearby NPC insane.

Each time the reader references the grimoire or casts a spell from it, the disturbing imagery, phrasing, and general evil nature require them to make a difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll. On a failed roll, they take 5 points of Intellect damage, descend one step on the damage track, and take one other action (determined by the GM) motivated by insanity. On a successful roll, they still take 2 points of Intellect damage.

There may be damaged copies of the Necronomicon in Greek and a handwritten version that was poorly translated into English and exists only in fragments. Supposedly the original Arabic version was lost or destroyed in a fire.

Depletion: —

PNAKOTIC MANUSCRIPTS 

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Tome with stony plates binding a sheaf of parchment

Effect: When a user reads aloud from the manuscripts, they can create either of the following effects, both of which put them at risk:

• Contact the mind of a powerful godlike being. The user must make

a difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll. On a failed roll, they take 5 points of Intellect damage, descend one step on the damage track, and take one other action (determined by the GM) motivated by insane panic. On a successful roll, they take 2 points of Intellect damage and learn the answer to one question, no matter the scope, from the mind contacted.

• Close a portal to a Lovecraftian planet or dimension. This requires reciting a chant from the book and might require an object that somehow relates to the portal (such as a piece of a creature from the destination). The user must make a difficulty 5 Intellect defense roll each round they chant from the manuscript. On a failed roll, they take 4 points of Intellect damage. On a successful roll, they take 2 points of Intellect damage and make progress toward closing the portal. A typical portal requires ten successes to close it. Another person can take over the chant if the previous person stops, but the first Intellect defense roll for their chanting is hindered.

Depletion: —

## SHINING TRAPEZOHEDRON

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Black spherical stone with red streaks and many irregular facets

Effect: Summons a messenger of

the Outer Gods (powerful and dangerous Lovecraftian entities): a bat-like, three-eyed creature called the Haunter of the Dark. The messenger can show its summoner wonders of the universe or teach them spells, but it requires human sacrifices, and if allowed to roam, it will hunt and commit murder. The stone is usually stored in a strangely angled hinged box made of yellow metal, decorated with carvings of weird alien beings.

Haunter of the Dark: level 6, magical knowledge and stealth as level 8; inflicts 6 points of Intellect damage; automatically banished in any light stronger than dim light

Depletion: —

## SILGARHO BULLET

Level: 1d6

Form: Hollow-point bullet

Effect: Silgarho (sil-gar-o) bullets are custom-made hollow bullets filled with a mixture of powdered silver (sil), garlic (gar), and holy water (ho), and sealed at the top with wax. They are designed to have an extra effect against vampires who have aversions to one or more of these substances. The bullet breaks open when it hits, scattering these materials into the wound. A silgarho bullet inflicts +1 point of damage and hinders the target’s actions for one round (this extra damage and hindered step is for each substance in the bullet that the vampire is averse to). Alternatively, the bullet can be fired against a hard surface such as a wall or floor, creating a cloud of dispersed material an immediate distance across, which lasts for one or two rounds and affects (for one round) any averse vampire who passes through it. Silgarho bullets are safe for vampires to handle—it’s only when broken open that they cause reactions.

One advantage of a silgarho bullet over a destructive cypher is that the bullet doesn’t count toward your cypher limit.

Depletion: Automatic 

## SPIRIT BOARD

Level: 1d6

Form: Weathered, flat piece of wood inked with letters and numbers 

Effect: Unlike the mass-produced parlor game, this handcrafted wooden board has the power to contact the spirit world. One or more people put their fingers on a wooden planchette and allow a supernatural force to move it around the board, spelling out words to answer questions from the participants. Each minute that the artifact is used, the users can ask one question from the spirits and get a general answer if one of them makes an Intellect roll (this might be modified by any skills or abilities the user has relating to ghosts or the supernatural); other participants can help with this task. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that could be found by looking somewhere other than the current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7; gaining knowledge of the future is normally impossible. 

Usually the spirits contacted by the board are benign or indifferent and will answer honestly. Sometimes the users contact a mischievous spirit who gives answers that are lies or half-truths for the sake of its own amusement, or perhaps to give the users a scare. However, there is always a chance that a hostile spirit (such as a demon or vengeful ghost whose level is equal to the artifact level) takes over the interaction. This may occur if there is a GM intrusion while using the board, if the question asked is too difficult for the contacted spirits to answer, or if the users fail to end the session by using the planchette to indicate “goodbye.” A hostile spirit’s answers are a mix of lies, contentious ambiguities, frightening predictions, and threats; it may choose to remain in the area for a while and haunt the participants.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100 (check each session)

## FAIRYTALE ARTIFACTS

Most artifacts in a Cypher System fairy tale setting are magical objects that have been either crafted via magic or later altered by or imbued with magic. There are a number of people and beings in fairy tale settings who are capable of creating artifacts by one or both of these methods. Additionally, some artifacts are products of magic or the setting itself. Thus, new artifacts are constantly entering the world, just waiting to be found and used by the characters.

## ARTIFACT QUIRKS

Magic runs through most items in a fairy tale world, but especially through artifacts. Magic is unknowable and mystifying, and thus something can—and often does—go wrong. While that may sometimes manifest as GM intrusions, it also shows up in artifacts as quirks. Every artifact has a quirk that sets it apart from mundane or lightly magical objects.

Quirks typically do not make an artifact more powerful, but they can make it more interesting, difficult, useful, or just unique. Some quirks manifest during an item’s creation, while others might appear (or disappear) after a particular experience, usually one involving magic. Quirks may come and go without notice, but typically an artifact can have only one quirk at a time and is rarely without a quirk for long.

A SELECTION OF FAIRY TALE ARTIFACTS 

A Tisket a Tasket

Level: 1d6

Form: Woven yellow basket with wooden handles

Effect: This basket can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical cat. Cyphers in the basket do not count against a character’s limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the basket)

Bounding Boots

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Beautifully made leather and gold boots that adjust to fit the wearer perfectly

Effect: The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher). 

Depletion: —

Boundless Bag

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small bag with two handles and a clasp

Effect: Any nonliving item held in the bag becomes a slightly more valuable item. For example, an inexpensive item becomes a moderately priced item, while a moderate item becomes an expensive item. The bag has no effect on items that are very expensive or exorbitant. The change takes a full day to take effect, during which time the item cannot leave the bag and the bag should not be opened. If the bag is opened, the process is canceled and must be started over.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6. When the effect depletes, it can still be used as a normal bag.

Putting all or part of

a living thing into a boundless bag is always risky, as more than one person has had their hand or head turned to gold (which might sound lovely, but typically isn’t). Also, doing so often causes the boundless bag to revert to a normal bag.

Items that create wealth in any fashion are particularly sought after. So much so that some items are believed to be cursed, due to the number of people who have met their untimely fate while in possession of a wealth-making artifact.

Boy Blue’s Horn

Level: 1d6

Form: Gleaming horn that never needs to be tuned or polished

Effect: When playing a lullaby, the horn puts every hearing living being in short range (including the user) to sleep for two rounds. When the horn plays something upbeat, the user and all allies within short range add +1 to their recovery rolls for ten minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20. After depletion, it continues to function as a regular horn.

Carving Knife of Sharpness

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Knife (light weapon)

Effect: This weapon functions as a normal knife of its kind. When the wielder gets a special major effect when attacking, they can choose to lop off one of the target’s limbs.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (roll on each major effect)

The GM determines the effect of a lost limb; however, many magical beings can withstand lost limbs with far more aplomb than a mortal creature will display in a similar situation.

Devils and Tailors

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Blood-stained draughtboard with figures of white gold, bronze, and pearl 

Effect: Playing someone in a game of checkers or draughts eases all of the user’s positive social interactions with their opponent. While playing, the user can make a move and interact with their opponent as a single action. The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each game played). After depletion, the board continues to function as a regular draughtboard.

You can determine the outcome of a game by having both players roll 2d6. The player with the highest number of pieces left on the board (highest roll) is the winner.

Fiddle of the Fossegrim

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Water-worn fiddle

Effect: Playing the fiddle causes everyone within long distance to become enticed by the music and draw closer to the player. After one round, all creatures in short range begin to dance uncontrollably for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. The only action they can take while dancing is to attempt to break free from the effect (an Intellect action equal to the artifact level).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Fortunate’s Purse

Level: 1d6

Form: Elegant knapsack that shifts colors to hide in plain sight

Effect: Any object put inside the sack cannot be detected by physical senses or magic. The sack can hold a single item, of any size and shape, at a time. Cyphers in Fortunate’s purse do not count against the user’s cypher limit.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time an item is added to the knapsack)

Magic bags come in many forms, such as coin purses, sacks, packs, and pockets. Some can be used to hide someone safely out of sight, provide an endless supply of gold or riches, or grant wishes. They are most often given as rewards for doing great kindnesses or completing a difficult task.

Galoshes of Fortune

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Pair of rubber boots

Effect: Transports the wearer to a time and place in the past or present that they desire for up to ten minutes. The wearer cannot be seen, heard, or sensed by others, and they cannot take any actions other than to watch events unfold. Traveling to and from the time and place causes the wearer to disappear from the present for two rounds.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Genie’s Lamp

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bronze oil lamp

Effect: Rubbing the lamp produces a genie who grants the user a wish. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish per day. 

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Genies, also called djinn or jinn, come in many forms, and not all of them are contained or controlled by something so simple as a lamp.

Golden Bridle

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Bridle made of flowing gold

Effect: To activate the bridle, the user must succeed on an Intellect interaction with a beast whose level does not exceed the artifact level. The bridle bonds to the creature, which immediately becomes calm. The creature awaits the user’s commands and carries out orders

to the best of its ability. The creature remains calmed for a number of hours equal to the artifact’s level minus the creature’s level. (If the result is 0 or less, the creature is enslaved for only one minute.)

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Hatchet of the Woodsman

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Well-worn hatchet of unremarkable appearance

Effect: When used on a creature, the hatchet turns the target into wood and inflicts damage equal to its level. If the creature is living wood, the hatchet turns them into nonliving wood. If the target is slain by the hatchet, the creature becomes animated wood. Effects last for ten minutes or until the target succeeds on an Intellect roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check on each successful attack)

Hook’s Hook

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Simple iron hook designed to be worn as a prosthetic

Effect: When placed on an amputated limb, the hook grafts on permanently. It works

as a simple hook and as a light weapon. When activated, Hook’s hook affects the

minds of all thinking foes within long range. Those affected are instilled with terror, making them drop whatever they’re holding and flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (for the fear ability). After depletion, it still functions as a hook and a weapon.

There are rumored to be any number of Hook’s hooks, all of which are made from different materials and serve different purposes, such as the scissors hook, oar hook, magnet hook, teacup hook, grappling-hook hook, and fishing rod hook. Enterprising characters might seek out multiple hooks, along with a way to exchange them easily.

Horn of Destruction

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Large brass horn

Effect: Blowing into the horn destroys all objects in an immediate area that is up to a long distance away, turning it all into rubble and debris. Living beings inside the area take 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

It is customary for the one who holds the horn of destruction to call themselves the King of Rubble and Debris and to wear a crown fashioned from talus and scree.

Iron Stove

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Iron stove that walks and talks 

Effect: Once per day, the stove can bake a

living gingerbread cookie. The baker chooses the form, but it must be a simple, one-dimensional shape (such as a human, a dog, or a tree). The cookie is a level 3 creature that can move, talk, and complete simple tasks that the baker asks of it. After a day, the cookie crumbles away.

Additionally, the iron stove can be used as a regular stove to heat water, cook meals, and so on.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100. After depletion, it remains a regular working stove, but no longer walks and talks.

A gingerbread being is not immune to dangers. Large amounts of liquids are likely to make it melt away, while birds and other scavengers have been known to try to take an eye or leg.

Knapsack of Sevens

Level: 1d6

Form: Simple knapsack

Effect: Tapping the knapsack seven times causes seven swans to fly out. For as long as the user does not speak or make any sounds, the swans fly around the user, providing them with +1 Armor against mental and physical attacks for the next ten minutes.

As soon as the user utters a sound, the swans return to the knapsack.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Mirror Mirror

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Ornate mirror that grows or shrinks in size according to its user’s needs. 

Effect: When the user looks into the mirror and interacts with it, it grants their request, as it is able. Roll a d6 to determine the mirror’s ability:

Most mirror mirrors have a personality all their own. Some sing their

answers, some show images, and still others sigh with boredom at being asked the same thing over and over.

Mirrors never lie. Except when they do.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

<table>

<col style="width: 4%" />
<col style="width: 95%" />
</colgroup>

| 1 | Answers a question about the present (such as “Who is the fairest of them all?”) with a simple one- or two-word answer. |
| 2 | Allows the viewer to check in on someone they know (and who knows them) from anywhere. The image lasts just a moment, and those being viewed are not aware that it has happened. |
| 3 | If the viewer stands before the mirror and shouts their own name three times, they are granted a glimpse of their future. This glimpse lasts just a moment, and is not guaranteed to come true.  |
| 4 | If the viewer stands before the mirror at midnight while holding a light source, they are able to contact the ghost or spirit of a person or creature they know the name of. Whether or not the being agrees to talk with them is another matter. |
| 5 | Distorts the appearance of everything it reflects, particularly by magnifying the horrible and ugly aspects of things and people while ignoring their good and beautiful aspects. Looking into the mirror inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Angling the mirror to reflect an object inflicts 2 points of damage to it. |
| 6 | Coats the user’s skin with its reflective surface, offering protection. The first time the user would take damage, the mirror shatters instead, reflecting the damage back to the user’s attacker. |

Pandora’s Box

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Elegant gold box with a hinged lid and a locked clasp

Effect: When the box is opened, light leaks out. The light coalesces into a golden form that represents a deep sense of peace and hope to the person who opened the box. For a number of rounds equal to the artifact level, the golden form eases all actions taken by the opener. Alternatively, the opener can share the effect of the golden form as their action, easing all actions taken by allies within short range (but not giving themselves the benefits).

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Pixie Dust

Level: 1d6

Form: Glass bottle filled with glittering light 

Effect: Shake the glittering light on a living

being and it can fly for ten minutes per artifact level. If the being can already fly, shaking the light on them grounds them, taking away their ability to be airborne for the same amount of time.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Red Cap

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Woolen cap soaked in human blood 

Effect: The wearer gains an extra recovery

roll each day that is not an action and does not count toward their daily limit. Once the wearer uses this recovery roll, they can’t do so again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll and soak the hat in fresh human blood.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day of use)

Red Riding Hood

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Bright red cloak that adjusts to fit its wearer

Effect: Draws the eye while also giving the wearer the impression of being easy prey. All tasks involving sneaking and hiding are hindered, and foes will typically attack the wearer over any others in the area. The cloak provides +3 Armor and an asset to all Might-based tasks, including combat tasks.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (check each day of use)

Self-Swinging Sword

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Steel sword with an ornate hilt 

Effect: When activated by a special word,

the sword attacks whoever the user indicates, fighting as a creature whose level is equal to the artifact level. Commanding the sword is not an action, but it can only do things that a sword would be able to do (attack, block, slice, and so on). If the sword is reduced to 0 health, the self-swinging ability ends and must be reactivated. The sword returns to the user when the duration ends.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (for the self-swinging ability). After depletion, it functions as a regular sword.

Seven-League Boots

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Lace-up knee-high boots of black leather

Effect: Allows the wearer to travel up to 21 miles (34 km) with a single step. Alternatively, two people may each wear one boot and travel up to 10.5 miles (19 km) with a single step. Seven-league boots exhaust the user, costing them 2 Might points per step.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each step). Once the movement ability depletes, the boots continue to function as regular boots.

Shapeshifter Wand

Level: 1d6

Form: Wand made of wood, glass, metal, or stone

Effect: Allows the user to turn one living being (including themself) into one of the following: flower, lake, duck, swan, cottage, rosebush, or fish. While in

their new form, the shapeshifted being retains all of their health and other attributes, but cannot perform any actions beyond what the non-magical item or creature could normally perform. So a flower can blow in the wind, bloom, attract insects, be cut, and smell nice. Any attempts to detect the shapeshifted being by physical senses or magic are hindered by two steps. While shapeshifted, the being cannot die; however, they can be injured, cursed, or moved down the damage track. The effect lasts for ten minutes or until the user chooses to end it early.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

She-Bear

Level: 1d6

Form: Bit of wood carved in the shape of a bear

Effect: When placed in the mouth, changes the wielder into the form of a female bear. While in this form, the user gains +4 to their Might Pool, +4 to their Speed Pool, and +1 to Armor. They also can communicate with other bears while in this form. The effect lasts for ten minutes.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Shirt of Nettles

Level: 1d6 + 4

Form: Woven shirt of stinging nettles 

Effect: The shirt acts as light armor, but grants an additional +2 Armor (+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 1 Armor that light armor typically provides. Additionally, the wearer can’t be shapeshifted against their will.

Depletion: — (At any time, the GM can rule that the shirt has resisted enough shapeshifting magic to deplete that ability, after which the shirt still functions as armor.)

Soldier’s Cloak of Invisibility

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Slate-grey cloak sewn of shadows and silence

Effect: Provides an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected (even by magic) for as long as the wearer does not interact with another creature. Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in any way breaks the effect.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Soulful Fiddle

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Fiddle made of bone and guts 

Effect: This instrument acts like a normal

fiddle of its kind. If the wielder is trained in its use and plays an appropriate tune, those within short range who hear it suffer one of the following effects: fall asleep, become amenable to suggestion, follow the fiddle player in a light trance, or take a similar action.

The desired effect must be the same for all creatures who hear it. The effect lasts for ten minutes, but actions by others (such as attacking the listeners or physically restraining them) can end the effect early for a creature.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 

Steadfast Tin Soldier

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small tin soldier with one leg 

Effect: Gives a user who is missing a

limb the ability to transform the tin soldier into a prosthetic limb with the appearance of their choosing. The limb permanently increases the user’s maximum Speed Pool or Might Pool (user’s choice) by 5 points (or 7 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher).

Depletion: —

It is rumored that there are a number of artifacts that create prosthetic body parts or restore missing limbs, including Paper Ballerina, Handless Maiden, and Bianca’s Snake.

Stone Canoe

Level: 1d6 + 3

Form: Shiny grey pebble, small enough to fit into a pocket

Effect: When activated, forms into a canoe that can carry a number of beings (and their equipment) equal to the artifact level. The canoe lasts for one day and then transforms back into a pebble.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6 (check each use)

Story Knife

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small penknife inscribed with tiny words in hundreds of languages 

Effect: Slices through words that are in the form of oral stories, songs, speeches, conversations, and so on. This has one of two effects, depending on the wielder’s desire (the wielder must decide before they activate the artifact each time):

• Makes the story, song, and so on sharper, stronger, and more interesting, increasing the chance that it will have an impact on listeners (eases any attempted interaction task)

• Makes the story, song, and so on boring, unwieldy, and disjointed, decreasing the chance that it will have the intended impact on listeners (hinders any attempted interaction task)

Using the story knife is an action. It has no power to cut physical objects or living beings (unless those beings are made of stories).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Table-Be-Set

Level: 1d6

Form: Common-looking wooden table 

Effect: Putting the table out and saying

“Table be set” automatically fills the table with as much food and drink as will fit upon its surface. The table does not become empty as long as there is anyone in long range who still wishes to eat. Once a character uses the table’s ability, they can’t do so again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

In addition to artifact quirks, common sense suggests that the

effects of some artifacts will draw additional interesting opportunities or dangers. Using table-be-set in the middle of a forest, for example, is likely to draw bears and other hungry beasts, while using it in the middle of town might garner the characters new friends, or catch the attention of thieves.

Tinderbox

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Small ornate tinderbox made of metal 

Effect: Summons three dogs to do the user’s bidding. The dogs can complete any tasks dogs would normally be able to accomplish, including carrying, fetching, attacking, defending, and so on. They act as a single level 3 creature.

Depletion: 1 in 1d6

Tweedledee’s Umbrella

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Large umbrella with a sharp point on the end

Effect: Touch a creature (up to the artifact’s level) of any size and the umbrella will fold up around it, capturing it inside. Holding the umbrella with the captive inside is an action. A caught character is held for ten minutes or until they make a successful Might roll to break free.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10

Vicious Tankard

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Hefty ale tankard carved of stone 

Effect: In addition to serving as a convenient means to drink a variety of liquids, if the tankard is topped off with good ale or spirits, it can be used as a medium weapon that inflicts +2 damage (for a total of 6 points of damage). Anyone who picks up the tankard is practiced

in using it in this fashion. Surprisingly, using the tankard as a melee weapon does not cause more than a modicum of good ale or spirits to slosh out.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each fight)

## EQUIPMENT

## MODERN FANTASY EQUIPMENT

In a modern fantasy setting, the following items (and anything else appropriate to a modern Earthlike world) are usually available. As with most physical things, a character can spend more for a higher-quality version of an item, such as an expensive altar cloth instead of a moderately priced one. Some of these price categories are higher than for a typical real-world item because items used with magic usually require higher quality or specific materials.

| Wedding dress (off the shelf) |                                      |

Many items in these lists are magical implements used with casting spells and performing rituals, but don’t have a specific purpose in the rules. The GM may decide that certain abilities or kinds of abilities require them or are hindered without them, such as using a crystal ball for a scrying spell, an athame for a protection spell, or a spirit board for a ritual to talk to a dead person.

## MODERN FANTASY CRAFTING MATERIALS

An inferior example of a crafting ingredient counts as one price category lower. A superior example counts as one or more price categories higher.

## SUPERHERO EQUIPMENT

## SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

Sometimes a group of superheroes needs special equipment so they can participate in an encounter or advance the story. For example, characters who must get to an underwater base will need air tanks or a water-breathing device, and those going on a short trip into space will need a vehicle and spacesuits. This sort of item doesn’t have to be a cypher (which counts against a character’s cypher limit) or an artifact (which has a depletion chance)—it can just be equipment. If a player suggests a suitable piece of equipment they can buy (such as scuba gear), or a gadgeteer or inventor character offers to build something to do the job, the GM should let them do it and handwave most of the details because they’re being creative and overcoming obstacles to move the story forward. In other words, don’t assume that every piece of weird equipment needs to be a cypher or artifact; things that allow the adventure to happen shouldn’t cost the characters much, or maybe not anything at all. And if the players take too much advantage of this leeway, the GM always has the option to use an intrusion to complicate an encounter.

ARMOR DESCRIPTIONS 

You can wear only one kind of armor at a time (wearing more than one only gives the Armor from the best one and the Speed Effort cost of the worst one). 

Beastskin: An improved form of hides and furs, usually crafted from a creature with especially tough skin such as a giant lizard or rhinoceros.

Breastplate: A fitted metal plate or set of plates that protect your torso but not your arms or legs, giving you greater movement than full plate at the cost of some protection. 

Brigandine: Long strips of metal attached to a cloth or leather backing. Often called “splint mail.” 

Chainmail: Mail armor made from hundreds of interlocking metal rings or links. Often called “chain” or “chain armor.” 

Dwarven breastplate: A high-quality breastplate crafted by a skilled dwarf, providing good protection and great mobility. Dwarven breastplate is medium armor (2 Armor) but encumbers the wearer as if it were light armor (it has a Speed Effort cost of 1). Not all dwarf-crafted breastplates count as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled dwarven smiths know how to make it). 

Elven chainmail: A high-quality suit of chainmail crafted by a skilled elf, providing good protection and excellent mobility. Elven chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor) but is no more encumbering than a typical outfit of normal clothing (it has no Speed Effort cost). Not all elf-crafted chainmail counts as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled elven smiths know how to make it). 

Full plate: A complete suit of fitted metal plates that give excellent coverage and protection against attacks. The joints are protected by small layered plates over flexible chain. Sometimes called “plate mail.” 

Heavy cloth: Clothing that’s heavy enough to reduce the effect of attacks against you, such as winter clothing or a fashionable leather outfit. Heavy cloth provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Heavy cloth doesn’t have a Speed Effort cost. It can’t be worn with other kinds of armor. 

Hides and furs: Made from thick or poorly cured animal skins. It’s heavier and bulkier than other kinds of leather armor, but easier to make, especially by resource-poor crafters. 

Leather jerkin: Armor made of hardened pieces of leather (usually boiled or treated with chemicals) that mainly covers your torso. It’s stiffer than leather used for clothing, but still flexible enough that you can bend and twist in it. Some jerkins are reinforced with metal studs (and may be called “studded leather”), and brigandine improves upon that concept. 

Padded: Cloth armor that is deliberately designed with multiple layers to be thick and protective. This is sometimes called “quilted armor” because it is a layer of padding sewn between two layers of cloth. Padded armor provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Padded armor doesn’t have a Speed Effort cost. It can’t be worn with other kinds of armor.

 Scale: Mail armor made from overlapping scales or plates attached to a leather or cloth backing. Often called “scale mail.” 

Shield: Provides an asset to Speed defense. Shield sizes vary from a small buckler to a large kite shield (in the Cypher System, the difference is mainly flavor, and for game purposes they all grant the wearer the same benefit).

\* Only against piercing and slashing attacks 

\*\* Using a shield provides the wearer with an asset on Speed defense tasks

If the GM prefers the simpler method of not tracking whether an attack is bashing, slashing, or stabbing, heavy cloth and padded armor should provide no Armor at all.

ADVENTURING EQUIPMENT 

Acid: A flask of strong acid. Can be thrown up to short range, inflicting acid damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured carefully, it can damage or destroy a small item or areas made of stone or metal. 

Adventuring pack: Includes 50 feet (15 m) of rope, three days’ iron rations, three spikes, small hammer, a set of warm clothes, boots, and three torches. 

Alchemist fire: A flask of chemicals that burst into flames upon contact with air. The flames burn out after one round. Can be thrown up to short range, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). 

Alchemist tools: A sturdy wooden case with tiny flasks, stirring rods, droppers, and other materials used in alchemy. It grants an asset for identifying potion cyphers and similar mysterious liquids. 

Bag of heavy tools: Contains a hammer, six spikes, crowbar, large tongs, chisel, and 10 feet (3 m) of strong rope. 

Bag of light tools: Contains a small hammer, small tongs, pliers, small pry bar, awl, lockpicks, 10 feet (3 m) of string, 3 feet (1 m) of metal wire, and a handful of nails. 

Battering ram: This sturdy plank is capped with hard metal. It provides an asset for breaking down doors. 

Book: A book with information on a particular topic, such as geography, history, magic, or religion. Provides an asset on appropriate rolls if the character reads or skims the book for at least ten minutes before attempting the task (this assumes the character has already read the book and is looking for relevant information). 

Caltrops, bag: A bag of hard things you scatter on the ground to slow or injure anyone walking through an area. One bag covers an immediate area and makes that area count as difficult terrain. A creature can safely move through it as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 2 Speed defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).

Candle: A candle burns for one hour and creates dim light in an immediate area. 

Climbing kit: A set of crampons, pitons, ropes, and tools. Provides an asset on climbing tasks. 

Crowbar: This bent length of metal grants an asset on tasks to open doors, treasure chests, and similar objects. 

Disguise kit: Makeup, simple prosthetics, and a wig or two, suitable for disguises for a theatrical production. Provides an asset on disguise tasks. Some parts are reusable, but the kit runs out after about five uses. 

Healing kit: A collection of bandages, needles, thread, and basic medicines. Provides an asset on healing tasks. Some parts are reusable, but the kit runs out after about five uses. 

Lamp: A hollow container filled with oil that slowly burns to provide light (often resembling a “genie lamp”). A lamp creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it might spill oil, break, or both. 

Lantern: An improved version of a lamp, with a wick that draws oil and glass or metal panes to protect it from wind. A lantern creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it is less likely to spill than a lamp.

Lockpicks: Also known as thieves’ tools, this set provides everything a skilled person needs to pick locks and disarm traps. 

Manacles: Metal or heavy wooden restraints that hold an enemy’s wrists or ankles in place and are secured with a pin. A common set of manacles is level 5. 

Oil: A pint (.5 L) of lamp oil in a leather flask. It burns for three to four hours in a lantern or lamp. If prepped with a burning wick, it can be thrown, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured on a flat surface, it makes an immediate area slippery. A creature can safely move through the oil slick as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 3 Speed defense roll or slip on the oil and fall prone. Lighting the oil slick makes it burn for one or two rounds and inflicts 1 point of fire damage (ignores Armor) on anyone in or moving through the area. 

Signal horn: This horn can be heard up to a mile away. 

Spyglass: This device grants an asset on perception tasks to see things at long range or longer. 

Tent: This has enough room for two humans or three smaller people. 

Torch: A wooden stick with some kind of fuel on one end (such as burlap and wax). It burns for one hour, creating normal light in an immediate area and dim light in the short area beyond that. A torch is fragile and usually breaks if used to hit something

## CLOTHING

## CLOTHING DESCRIPTIONS

Specific pieces of clothing vary by climate and local custom, but usually include a hat, shirt, belt, pants or skirt, shoes, and underclothes. 

Artisan’s outfit: A suitable outfit for a person who performs a trade (blacksmith, cobbler, and so on). Often includes an apron and a belt for holding tools. 

Ascetic’s outfit: A simple outfit worn by monks and other people who eschew displays of wealth and status. Specific styles vary by climate and the philosophical tenets of the wearer, but a typical example is a loose shirt, loose breeches, sandals, a cap, and several cloth straps that can serve as a belt, scarf, or simple adornments. 

Cold-weather outfit: A heavier set of clothing for protection against cold weather. 

Entertainer’s costume: Interesting (and usually colorful) clothing appropriate for an entertainer such as an actor, bard, juggler, or acrobat. 

Explorer’s outfit: A set of sturdy clothing for adventurers and experienced travelers who want to be prepared for various activities and environments. 

Fancy outfit: A stylish set of clothes according to the local fashions and customs. Generally the minimum required for meeting with important townsfolk such as a mayor or noble. Higher-status events require outfits that cost up to four times as much. 

Peasant’s outfit: Very simple clothing for free people of low social status. Includes a kerchief or cap, shirt or blouse, trousers or skirt, and heavy cloth shoes or foot wrappings. 

Priestly vestments: Garments appropriate for performing ceremonies for a specific religion. A common example is a hat or headdress, long tunic or dress, tabard or stole, and shoes, with the outer pieces marked with appropriate symbols. 

Traveler’s outfit: A comfortable set of clothes that includes gloves, a protective hat, a jacket, and a cloak with a hood. 

Wizard’s outfit: Clothing that identifies the wearer as a practitioner of arcane magic. A typical outfit includes an interesting hat or cap, a robe with long sleeves and many pockets, and shoes, often adorned with runes or representations of magical creatures such as dragons. Scholars and sages wear very similar garments that lack the mystical aspects of wizard clothing.

## POST-APOCALYPTIC EQUIPMENT

Currency

In your setting, you may want a new currency that PCs can use to purchase goods and services

that fall into the various price categories. Currency of some sort can be used in places where survivors trust each other enough not to steal or kill for resources.

A few options are described here.

Loot

The “loot” result on the Useful Stuff table lists before‑times collectibles, such as gold eagle coins, jewelry, and designer wristwatches. A starving survivor would likely scoff at accepting any of these as currency. But in an established community or trade town, such items might retain some value, though they’re worth only a fraction of what they were before the apocalypse. In general, the price category for such things is two ranks lower than before the apocalypse.

Ammunition

| Price Category | Rounds of Ammo |
|----------------|----------------|
| Inexpensive    | 1 bullet       |
| Moderate       | 10 bullets     |
| Expensive      | 500 bullets    |
| Very expensive | 1,000 bullets  |
| Exorbitant     | 10,000 bullets |

Other Currency Options

Seeds: If stored correctly, seeds might make reasonable currency. Some seeds could be more valuable than others, especially if it could be demonstrated that they are viable. For example, ten viable seeds might be worth an inexpensive item or service.

Water: After an apocalypse, clean and drinkable water could become scarce. Measuring out water could become a standard in some locations. Case in point, 1/3 cup (80 ml) of water might be worth an inexpensive item or service.

Fuel: Gasoline might be considered liquid gold, assuming working vehicles also exist. However, if you’re adhering strictly to the shelf life of common things, you’ll also have to include a new source for usable gasoline after all the stuff from the before‑times goes bad. For instance, a quarter‑gallon (1 L) of gasoline might be worth an inexpensive item or service.

Drugs: From over‑the‑counter painkillers to prescription medications, the drugs found in a pharmacy could be the basis for currency. Over time, they would probably become more valuable because people are likely to go through their treasure hoard of aspirin or antibiotic. Thus, one aspirin or other pain‑relief tablet might be worth an inexpensive item or service.

Scrip: A large and somewhat organized post‑apocalyptic group might produce its own vouchers or tokens to pay its members for services rendered. Such scrip might have value outside the group or be considered worthless, depending on your setting.

Additional Post-Apocalyptic Equipment

The additional post‑apocalyptic equipment in the Cypher System Rulebook has been incorporated into this expanded equipment list, so you and your players don’t need to cross‑reference to make sure you’re not missing anything.

Inexpensive Items

| Weapons | Notes |
|----|----|
| Knife | Rusty and worn |
| Light weapon, Improvised | Chair, ice skate, frying pan, etc; could break after one combat |
| Wooden Club |  |

| Armor       | Notes                                        |

## POST-APOCALYPTIC CYPHERS AND ARTIFACTS

Post-Apocalyptic Cyphers

Subtle Cyphers

Subtle cyphers are appropriate if your game’s pre‑apocalyptic world was realistic (like our modern world) right up until it was destroyed and if the disaster was a realistic cataclysm (like a pandemic, climate disaster, or war).

Optional Rule: Transferring Subtle Cyphers

A PC with a subtle cypher can use it on an ally they can touch and speak with as their action instead of gaining the effect themself. They manage this feat by motivating the recipient through speech and interaction, effectively inspiring the recipient in the same way the subtle cypher would have affected the character with the cypher. This uses the action of the character activating the cypher, not the recipient.

Manifest Cyphers

Manifest cyphers in a post‑apocalyptic game might be remnants of the technology or magic that civilization used before it fell, or the technology or magic that caused the end of the world.

Scavenger Subtle Cyphers

Resource scarcity, including lack of water and food, threatens PCs in most post‑apocalyptic settings. Enter scavenger subtle cyphers. These give PCs one more way to find useful stuff like edible food, clean water, a helpful tool, extra ammo, or other needful things.

Discovering Scavenger Subtle Cyphers: Anytime PCs in your game are eligible for discovering a subtle cypher, consider giving someone in the group a scavenger subtle cypher. No more than one PC in the group should have a scavenger subtle cypher at any given time. Once they use it, you can give another PC in the group one, preferably something different.

Using a Scavenger Subtle Cypher: The character uses their action to activate the scavenger subtle cypher, as usual. At the end of their turn, they gain the indicated resource.

Additional Post-Apocalyptic Manifest Cyphers

Manifest cyphers are sometimes found in the ruins of Radio Quiet. One variety PCs might discover are AI‑fashioned. When activated, the cypher dematerializes, swirling out into a cloud of free‑floating tiny machines that create the cypher’s effect through direct manipulation before burning out or dispersing.

Effect: AI‑fashioned cyphers can provide nearly any effect described for cyphers in the Cypher System Rulebook, as well as the effects described for the new manifest cyphers in the following section.

Secondary Effect: Any time an AI‑fashioned manifest cypher is used, there’s a chance the AI who created it for their own ambiguous purpose becomes aware, if that instance still operates somewhere. That usually has no bearing on the situation, but if the PC triggers an intrusion while using the cypher, a fledgling instance of the AI tries to install on the PC, who must succeed on an Intellect defense roll against the cypher’s level to avoid coming under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI’s goals.

AI-Fashioned Manifest Cyphers

| D10 | Cypher                  |
|-----|-------------------------|
| 1   | AI instance             |
| 2   | Armor breach            |

| 8   | Fabricator, civil       |
| 9   | Fabricator, military    |
| 10  | Smartdust               |

## AI INSTANCE

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Installs an AI instance in an inert object. The instance persists for about a day. The AI’s level is equal to this cypher's level. The AI has the ability to understand and audibly synthesize nearly any language and can provide answers to questions. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the higher its level. The instance can only answer questions equal to its level or less. Generally, knowledge that could be found by looking somewhere other than the current location is level 1 or higher, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. If the AI answers a question of level 5 or higher, the instance’s existence terminates. Alternatively, the AI can be used to engage another AI in the area, distracting it from taking direct actions for a number of minutes equal to this cypher’s level. After this interval, the instance’s existence terminates.

## ARMOR BREACH

Level: 1d6

Effect: A successfully targeted creature or object within short range becomes coated with a clinging film of nanotech for one minute. While coated, a creature has 2 less Armor than usual (3 less if the cypher is level 5 or 6). While coated, an object temporarily moves one step down the object damage track (or two steps down if the cypher is level 5 or 6).

## DATA WIPE

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: A successfully targeted AI instance within short range whose level is equal to or less than this cypher’s level is suppressed and unable to function for one minute. If this cypher’s level is 7 or higher, a success means the instance is permanently wiped from the hardware (or wetware, if installed on a living creature).

## DENATURE NANOTECH

Level: 1d6 + 3

Effect: Coats a short area surrounding the user, or adjacent to the user, with a nearly invisible film of nanotech that lasts for years. The first time anyone attempts to use a nanotech‑based cypher, ability, or other effect in the affected area whose level is less than this cypher’s level, that use is suppressed and fails. Once one effect is suppressed, the denaturing effect is expended. The cypher instead can be used to end one ongoing nanotech effect of the cypher’s level or less in a short area, but the user must succeed on an Intellect attack roll against the level of the effect or the target creating the effect. For instance, if this cypher is successfully used against a creature genetically engineered by nanotech, the creature would become so much inert biological matter.

## DETONATION (PRION)

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away that bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level. On a hit, the living tissue of targets whose level is less than the cypher’s level begins to unravel due to a prion‑unfolding chain reaction. These targets take damage equal to the cypher’s level on the first round, then 1 point of damage each subsequent round until only so much cloudy pink fluid remains. PCs can make a Might defense roll each round to end the effect; two successful defense rolls end the chain reaction. NPCs whose level is equal to or higher than the cypher’s level take damage from the cypher for only one round.

## DISASSEMBLER

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Recycles waste or other unwanted material by breaking it down to constituent atoms and molecules. If used destructively, this cypher can disassemble an object within immediate range whose level is equal to or less than the cypher’s level that fits into a 10‑foot (3.5 m) cube, or it can create a cavity of the same volume in a larger object whose level is less than the cypher’s level. If used as a weapon against creatures, the cypher can be hurled a short distance like a detonation, inflicting damage equal to the cypher’s level in an immediate area and reducing the effectiveness of any Armor worn by targets by 1.

## DISASSEMBLER, EPHEMERAL

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: An object or creature whose level is equal to or less than this cypher’s level within immediate range is temporarily disassembled into its component atoms and molecules. The disassembly lasts for up to ten hours or until a time specified by the user, whichever occurs first. When the effect ends, the object or creature is reassembled over the course of one round at the location where it was disassembled (or at the location the fine “dust” of its disassembly was moved to). A Speed attack roll is necessary to affect an unwilling target. PCs can make a Might defense roll to resist being disassembled.

## FABRICATOR, CIVIL

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: Assembles a specified object whose level is equal to the cypher’s level. Once created, the object is permanent until destroyed. A civil fabricator can build one object on the Additional Post‑Apocalyptic Equipment table (or another equipment table in the Cypher System Rulebook) that falls into the “other items” category—no weapons or armor. The user chooses which item to fabricate by speaking aloud the name of the item they want as they activate the cypher. The higher the cypher level, the more expensive an item the fabricator can create, as follows: Level 2 cyphers can fabricate inexpensive items, cyphers of level 3 or less can fab inexpensive and moderately priced items, cyphers of level 6 or less can fab up to expensive items, and level 7 cyphers can fab up to very expensive items.

A civil fabricator can create appropriately priced food items. However, it can’t fabricate living creatures.

## FABRICATOR, MILITARY

Level: 1d6 + 1

Effect: A military fabricator cypher functions like a civil fabricator; however, it can be used to create armor or weapons. If a weapon that uses ammunition is fabricated, the weapon’s magazine holds up to ten rounds of fabbed ammunition.

## SMARTDUST

Level: 1d6 + 2

Effect: Coats an area up to a short distance in diameter with a nearly invisible film of nanotech that lasts for a number of months equal to the cypher’s level. Afterward, the user can see, hear, smell, and feel the vibrations of any activity that occurs in that location no matter how far they are from it.

## PRE-APOCALYPTIC ARTIFACTS

One interesting approach for artifacts in a post‑apocalyptic setting is to use before‑times items that were once commonplace—such as books, functioning vehicles, and portable water filters, among many other items—but are now nearly impossible to manufacture and hard to preserve. The depletion roll for such items represents the likelihood that the item will fall apart, break down, or run out. The upshot of adopting such a system for your game is that nearly every nonfood item on the Useful Stuff table is also a pre‑apocalyptic artifact. Give most of these items a depletion of 1 in 1d20; however, if the item seems particularly hardy, a roll of 1d100 is appropriate. If particularly flimsy or prone to being used up, a depletion of 1d10 or 1d6 would be in order. Refer to the following examples as a guide for adapting before‑times Useful Stuff objects into artifacts with a specific depletion.

Book

Level: 1d6

Form: Textbook, how‑to book, or other nonfiction book of knowledge on one topic; may be moldy or otherwise damaged

Effect: This book covers a particular topic or area of knowledge determined by the GM. A reader who studies it for an hour has an asset on a related Intellect task.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Faraday Cake

Level: 3

Form: Container made of metal mesh, of variable size (usually up to the size of a room)

Effect: Blocks electromagnetic signals from reaching the interior of the cage.

Depletion: —

Salvaged Car

Level: 1d6

Form: Rusted vehicle, with parts cobbled together from multiple before‑times vehicles

Effect: Transports five characters a very long distance on each turn in an open cab or, if level 6, a closed cab.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each time the engine is started or the car begins a trip)

Water Filter

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Large pitcher with built‑in filter

Effect: Purifies enough drinking water for one character per artifact level every day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each day used)

## POST-APOCALYPTIC ARTIFACTS

The kinds of post‑apocalyptic artifacts described in the Cypher System Rulebook are, for the most part, retro‑futuristic, or at least manifest cyphers created by super‑science that is mostly beyond today’s technology. Most of these would fit in almost any post‑apocalyptic setting that includes fantastic elements, especially if reskinned to be thematically appropriate. The artifacts presented below include artifacts appropriate to an End Times apocalypse, an apocalypse caused by the rise of antagonistic AIs (such as in Radio Quiet), and alien tech possibly brought by invading or terraforming aliens. That said, any artifact could potentially be the result of AI artifice. Such artifacts usually have a fractal quality to their form, as is the case for AI‑fashioned cyphers. And like AI‑fashioned cyphers, a triggered intrusion could endanger the user if an instance of the artificial intelligence that created the item tries to install itself on the PC’s wetware (mind).

| D20   | Apocalypse            | Artifact                 |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1-2   | Retro-futuristic      | Autodoc\*                |
| 3-4   | Alien                 | Carbonizer               |
| 5-6   | Retro-futuristic      | Enviroscanner\*          |
| 7     | Alien or AI-fashioned | Memory Eraser            |
| 8     | Retro-futuristic      | Military exoskeleton\*   |
| 9     | AI-fashioned          | Mutation Inducer         |
| 10-12 | AI-fashioned          | Nanorifle                |
| 13    | Retro-futuristic      | Rocket first\*           |
| 14-16 | Retro-futuristic      | Rocket-propelled grenade |
| 17    | End Times             | Seal of Solomon          |
| 18    | End Times             | Spear of Destiny         |
| 19    | Retro-futuristic      | Terahertz scanner\*      |
| 20    | Alien                 | Transfer discs           |

\*Artifacts presented in the Cypher System Rulebook

Carbonizer

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Tiny silver device with multiple prong‑like barrels

Effect: This weapon fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact’s level that ignores Armor (including Armor granted by force fields). A target killed by a carbonizer is turned completely to dust.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Memory Eraser

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Handheld reflective mass

Effect: A flash of nano‑textured light erases the last few minutes of memory in all creatures within immediate range that the user makes a successful Intellect attack on (one attack roll per target).

Depletion: 1 in 1d20

Mutation Inducer

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Handheld reflective device with gradually evolving fractal textures

Effect: A targeted willing or helpless creature within immediate range is transformed over the course of one minute, gaining a randomly determined beneficial mutation. If the artifact is level 6 or higher, the target instead gains a powerful mutation. Mutations gained by the inducer fade within about a day.

Depletion: 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, target also gains a harmful mutation)

Nanorifle

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Sleek two‑handed reflective device with gradually evolving fractal textures

Effect: This weapon contains an onboard AI that assists the user, granting an asset to any attacks made with the weapon. The weapon fires a stream of nanomachine rounds at a target within long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact’s level. In addition, if the target fails an Intellect defense roll, they are affected as if with a minor AI instance hazard, coming under the control of the AI housed in the nanorifle rather than a random artificial intelligence. The AI usually works with the user to exert control over the target. Control lasts for about a minute.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Seal of Solomon

Level: 1d6 + 2

Form: Signet ring bearing a star design

Effect: The wearer can attempt to command a demon, a devil, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, an angel, or a similar entity by making a successful Intellect attack roll against a target within short range. An affected target must do as requested for up to one minute (if the creature is level 5 or lower) or for one round (if the creature is level 6 or higher). The ring also grants the wearer the ability to understand and communicate with animals.

Depletion: 1 in 1d100

Spear of Destiny

Level: 7

Form: Heavy spear of ancient manufacture

Effect: Attacks with this spear are eased. If used against a supernatural creature such as a demon, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, or an angel, it ignores Armor, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (10 points total). If an attack with the spear kills a target normally able to return to existence (such as a Horseman), the target is truly destroyed instead.

Depletion: —

Spear of Destiny GM GM intrusion: The wielder’s heart is not pure enough to permit the use of the spear, and it burns the character for 7 points of ambient damage each round they use it.

Transfer Discs

Level: 1d6 + 1

Form: Two or more matching discs 3 feet (1 m) in diameter

Effect: The user can step between deployed transfer discs, teleporting any distance. If a series of discs is deployed in a network, the user receives a mental map of the discs upon stepping on any one of them, and they can navigate by stepping on each intervening disc between their current location and their desired location. To deploy a disc as their action, the user places it on a mostly level, secure surface and must succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect‑based roll.

Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check after each day of use)

## SCIENCE FICTION EQUIPMENT

EQUIPMENT & ARMAMENTS

Equipment: Equipment includes apparel, armor, cybernetic implants, personal drone assistants, and other items that, for the most part, can be easily transported. Technically speaking, armaments are also equipment. Unless it’s important to make a distinction, assume all guidance regarding “equipment” also applies to armaments. But when it is important to make a distinction, the term “armaments” is used for equipment that is also a weapon.

Armaments: From contemporary bullet-firing pistols to fantastically advanced handheld disintegration guns, the weapons presented in this chapter are dedicated to those that a single character can carry and use.

## VARIABLE COST BY TECH RATING

Equipment costs assume the setting is predominantly of same tech rating as the object’s tech rating. The price drops by one price category if the setting tech rating is, generally speaking, greater than the object’s tech rating.

Note, however, that inexpensive items do not become free; they remain inexpensive.

## WEAPON OPTIONS GRANTED BY TYPE OR FOCUS

When a player makes up their character, their type likely indicates that they can choose one or more weapons of their choice. When choosing such weapons and equipment, the following restrictions apply to that choice:

• Characters must choose weapons within, or less than, the average tech rating of the setting. 

• Characters may not choose weapons in the exorbitant or priceless price category.

CONTEMPORARY STYLING IN ADVANCED OR FANTASTIC SETTINGS 

Equipment listed as contemporary can often be had in hard science fiction or fantastic genres, possibly at a lower price. Note that such equipment available in these future worlds are not necessarily antiques (though they could be), but rather cheaply made objects. 

## EQUIPMENT POWER

For the most part, assume that equipment is either self-powered, or easily powered by charging fields or other ubiquitous and freely available sources. That is, unless a piece of equipment losing power makes a good GM intrusion in a clutch situation.

## CUSTOMIZING EQUIPMENT

Listing all possible armaments and equipment and their many variants across all three tech ratings, at least in the space available, isn’t an option. However, a representative cross section is provided. If you’re looking for something that isn’t noted, look for something close and adapt the listing

## EQUIPMENT LISTING

## COMMUNICATION

## LIGHTSPEED COMMUNICATION DELAYS

For ease of reference, the light delay table provides the time it takes light from the sun to each planet in our solar system, plus a few other notable locations. To figure light delays between two different locations, subtract the time delay of the object closer to the sun from the time delay of the object farther away. The difference is the light delay between those two locations. Double times for two-way communication

## LIGHT DELAY TABLE

| Location          | AU   | Light Delay |
|-------------------|------|-------------|
| Mercury           | 0.4  | 3 minutes   |
| Venus             | 0.7  | 6 minutes   |
| Earth             | 1.0  | 8 minutes   |
| Mars              | 1.5  | 13 minutes  |
| Asteroid belt     | 2.7  | 22 minutes  |
| Jupiter           | 5.2  | 43 minutes  |
| Saturn            | 9.5  | 79 minutes  |
| Uranus            | 19   | 160 minutes |
| Neptune           | 30   | 4 hours     |
| Inner Kuiper Belt | 30   | 4 hours     |
| Pluto             | 39   | 6 hours     |
| Outer Kuiper Belt | 50   | 7 hours     |
| Inner Oort Cloud  | 5k   | 29 days     |
| Outer Oort Cloud  | 100k | 19 months   |
| Proxima Centauri  | 269k | 4.2 years   |

Level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

A data processing and data-access tool that enables all sorts of creative and comprehension tasks. 

Satellite phone 

Level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As smartphone (though far bulkier), but with ability to connect directly to an orbiting satellite communication network, providing planetary range.

## ADVANCED

Communicator, badge/ring 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

As satellite phone, but so small it can be worn as a stylish insignia or badge on a cuff, chest, pendant, or carried in a pocket; as a ring worn on a finger, earlobe, or other pierced appropriate or pierced body part; or threaded into a tattoo on wrist or back of hand. Has full voice functionality, including on-the-fly translation (for languages in a network-connected database), and audibly duplicates most smartphone functions. 

A communicator badge in the form of ring is often referred to as a data-ring.

AR glasses 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Sturdy (and sometimes stylish) eyeglasses or goggles provides all the functions of a contemporary smartphone (including communication) and communicator badge, plus is capable of both immersive VR and overlaid HUD and augmented reality functions. Can be worn inside a space suit helmet or incorporated directly into one. 

AR contacts 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive x2 

As AR glasses, but are lenses fitted to the eye. Also called “smartacs.” 

Courier 

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

Essentially a tiny rocket that can exceed human-rated Gs to “quickly” deliver messages across planetary distances if radio (via DSM network), laser, or even graser communication is deemed too susceptible to interception by a third party. A courier must be launched in a micro-gravity environment. 

Laser array

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate. Useful for ship-to-ship communication for “tight” beaming information; even highly focused lasers spread out to several miles after only traveling a few light-seconds, diminishing their usefulness. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered). 

Graser array

 level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

As laser array, but collimates gamma rays, which diverge far less quickly than light, allowing communication between planets. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered).

## FANTASTIC

Mind’s eye 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As contemporary AR glasses, but directly incorporated into the brain as cortical implant. Incorporation grants eidetic memory, the ability to link senses between authorized users within network range, and some control over brain chemistry, granting an asset on all tasks the user attempts to control or moderate their own reactions. 

Ansible 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate, and which requires enormous power per use, allows instantaneous communication between two points even across interstellar distances.

## SENSE-ENHANCING TOOLS

Some communication devices also provide sense-enhancing abilities, such as the smartphone, AR glasses and contacts, and the mind’s eye implant. 

## CONTEMPORARY

Binoculars 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate 

Provides an asset for perception tasks at range. 

Camera, surveillance 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Wireless transmission to internet node, radio within long range, or flash storage to be picked up physically at a later date; includes microphone and ability to have conversation through camera speakers. 

Microscope 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Provides an asset to any research task where small-scale perception could provide additional information, though analysis requires several hours or more. 

Nightvision goggles

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Reasonably accurate vision in complete darkness, up to 100 m (330 feet). 

Analysis apparatus 

level 4 (12) 

Exorbitant 

Any one of a number of pieces of lab equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate, including chromatography columns, mass spectrometers, calorimetry analyzers, and more. Such a piece of equipment grants two assets to any analysis task where perception could provide additional information, though analysis requires several hours or more.

## ADVANCED

Hand scanner 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Smartphone-like device customized for analysis; provides an asset for identifying tasks. 

White noise generator 

level 5 (15) 

Expensive 

Fist-sized device that fuzzes frequencies all across the spectrum, hindering all electronic perception and surveillance tasks within short range by five steps. 

Lab-on-a-chip 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Portable 15 cm (6 inch) cube with many inputs and readouts (and network connections). Eases any research task where small-scale perception could provide additional information by two steps, though analysis requires about ten minutes. 

Research drone 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Autonomous frames about 1 m (3 feet) in rough diameter fitted with all manner of surveillance devices, including visual, audio, chemical, and lab-on-a-chip functionality. Propelled by rotors in an atmosphere or micro-thrusters in vacuum. Research drones can also be controlled through AR glasses or smartphones to any distance communications reach. 

Tactile drone 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As research drone, except without the suite of analysis tools, providing only audible and visual feeds back to controller (if there is one), but with physical options; tactile drones can accomplish routine tasks and attempt those of level 4 or less, or allow a remote operator to attempt more difficult tasks at a distance.

## FANTASTIC

Multicorder 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Handheld device provides two assets and one free level of Effort to any perception, analysis, or computing task that the device’s multiple sensors (including radio, gravimetric, chemical, visual, audio, and others) within short range. Analysis requires only one round to complete. 

An ability granting a free level of Effort usually must be unlocked by the application of at least one level of Effort, in effect providing one more level of Effort than what was paid for

Probe drone 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

More advanced version of a contemporary research drone that can be deployed to other planets and even star systems to gather environmental and tactical information, which is transmitted back. If forced to defend itself, this level 6 robot has Armor 3 and two long-range energy blasts each round that inflict 8 points of damage each. 

Sonic toolgrip 

level 6 (18)

Exorbitant 

Handheld toolgrip manifests a sonic effector field that serves as a multifunctional tool in a wide variety of circumstances. Suitable for picking a lock, unscrewing a bolt, analyzing the interior of an object, as a microphone, for tracking movement, hacking electronics, charging electronics, or even tuned to a high-intensity beam that can blind nearby targets for a round. The sonic toolgrip eases all tasks by two steps.

APPAREL & ARMOR

Unless the GM is running some kind of survival-related scenario, characters can be presumed to have basic clothing and footwear suitable to their environment. CONTEMP

## CONTEMPORARY

Cold weather gear 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Insulated clothing, including gloves, boots, and facemask, that allows wearer to function in extremely cold environments for several hours at temperatures down to –90 degrees C (–130 degrees F). 

Elegant clothes 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Clothing suitable for moving in elite circles; provides an asset to interaction checks in some situations. 

SCUBA gear 

level 4 (12)

Expensive 

Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus allows wearer to function underwater for about an hour at depths (under normal Earth atmosphere) of up to 40 m (130 feet)

## CONTEMPORARY ARMOR

Leather jacket 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate Functions as light armor (+1 Armor). 

Kevlar vest 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor). 

Military body armor, light 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor), encumbers as light armor. 

Military body armor

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Functions as heavy armor (+3 Armor).

Remember, armor (lowercase a) is something you wear. Armor (capital A) is the bonus you get. You can have only one type of armor at a time, but you can have many sources of Armor, theoretically.

## ADVANCED

Safesuit, space 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate 

Cheap, mass-produced one-size-fits-all vacuum-protection “suit” (sometimes they look more like a bag) of thin polymer suitable for emergency decompression events but not for long-term use. Can be put on and sealed with one action, but any physical action taken while wearing one is subject to automatic GM intrusions on a d20 die roll of 1 or 2. If a roll triggers a GM intrusion, the suit tears.

Breather 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate/Expensive 

A facemask providing a day of breathable air in poisonous or low-oxy atmospheres, or continuously for expensive breathers with recycling and oxy extraction features. If used in a vacuum, a breather provides the wearer three rounds of action before the full effects of vacuum begin dropping them on the damage track. 

Exoskin, grav-assist 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Powered anthropomorphic exoskeleton allows completely normal function in high gravity environments of up to 5 G. Exoskins are related to loader mechs. Increase the cost category by one to grant +1 Armor. 

Shipboots 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Any footwear that allows variable magnetic adhesion to a surface; cancels the hindrance to all physical actions suffered by those acting in zero-gravity conditions. 

Pressure suit 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

A full-body suit similar to a space suit, but only rated for regions of low pressure (not vacuum) such as is typically found on Mars. Some come integrated with breathers (at double the cost). 

Exoskin, brute 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As grav-assist exoskin, but high-tensile effectors ease all tasks related to Might. 

Exoskin, reactive 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

As grav-assist exoskin, but integrated memory fibers ease all tasks related to Speed. 

Space suit 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Protects a wearer from vacuum and allows basic normal activities in space. Requires about four rounds to put on and seal (going quicker risks a bad seal). Provides about ten hours of atmo in a vacuum without refurbishment. Extremely limited maneuvering thrusters provide a couple of opportunities to correct a poorly aimed jump through zero G. Shipboots are usually built in. 

“Atmo” is the catch-all term for oxygenated, breathable air and livable pressure.

Stealthsuit 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Provides two assets to stealth tasks. 

Swimsuit, hydrodynamic 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Next-generation materials repel water, increase oxygen consumption, and shape swimmer’s body to better swimming ideal; provides two free levels of Effort to swimming tasks. 

Space suit, deluxe 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive x2 

As space suit, but deluxe and durable. A deluxe suit features built-in recyclers granting air, water, and nutrition for about a week of continuous use. Microthrusters allow for continuous zero-G maneuvering over a period of ten minutes, or even more if air reserves are tapped (which depletes them). If the suit is breached because of external damage, self-sealing tech limits repercussions described in Taking Damage in a Space Suit to just a round or two, assuming the breach is not catastrophically large.

## TAKING DAMAGE IN A SPACE SUIT

Taking damage while protected from the effects of vacuum in a space suit (or safesuit) requires one additional defense roll. On a failure, the suit breaches and begins to spew precious air, heat, and pressure into the void. Deluxe space suits have auto-sealing functionality, repairing the puncture within a round. But during any round a suit is leaking, all tasks are hindered as the spray of venting atmosphere jerks or even spins the character around. Those with less advanced suits must find some way to seal the breach within three rounds, otherwise on the fourth round, they are treated as if in vacuum.

## ADVANCED ARMOR

Armored bodysuit 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor), encumbers as if not wearing any armor. 

Body armor, lightweight

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Functions as heavy armor (+3 Armor), encumbers as if wearing medium armor. 

Paint-on impact armor 

level 5 (15) 

Expensive 

Not armor; offers +1 to Armor, applied by spraying nanosolution from spray applicator over clothing and skin, lasts ten minutes; each applicator depletes 1 in 1d10 uses. 

Battlesuit 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Functions as heavy armor (+3 Armor), also grants the benefit of a deluxe space suit. 

Holobit 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Not armor; wearable device projects an offset hologram of the wearer, providing an asset to Speed defense tasks. 

Battlesuit, deluxe 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

As battlesuit, but with armor and power assist; the battlesuit grants an additional +1 to Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually offers, and encumbers as medium armor. Armor rating also applies to damage that often isn’t reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage).

## FANTASTIC

Breather, vacuum 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Facemask generates a variable forcefield around wearer that provides comfortable temperature and atmo to wearer in poisonous atmospheres, underwater, or in vacuum, for several hours, even without a space suit. 

Bounding boots 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Gravity-assist boots provide two free levels for Effort for jumping and running tasks. In addition, wearer can fall from any height safely if prepared for the descent. 

Cloak, chameleon 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Renders wearer essentially invisible save for hardly-noticeable distortions for up to ten minutes. Provides one asset and one free level of Effort to stealth tasks.

An ability granting a free level of Effort usually must be unlocked by the application of at least one level of Effort, in effect providing one more level of Effort than what was paid for.

## FANTASTIC ARMOR

Force field, quick 

level 4 (12)

their Might Pool.

Force field, omni 

level 6 (18) 

> Exorbitant

As quick force field, but permanent while active, requires no recharge period. In addition, the wearer can tune the field so that it’s hazed and translucent, hiding their identity, or make it fully dark so that it emits no light (though they can see through the field normally).

Kinetic ring 

level 6 (18) 

> Exorbitant
>

wearer’s Speed defense roll. If the projectile still hits the wearer, the field grants +1 to Armor

against the attack.

Gun armor 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant x2

As battle armor, but armor includes a deployable integrated long-range plasma weapon that inflicts 6 points of damage. It’s able to fire autonomously, allowing the wearer to take some

other action (though if set to do so, automatic GM intrusions occur on 1–3 on a d20, and if

triggered, result in friendly fire).

Inexpensive 

As flashlight, but radioisotope power cell allows the light to shine a bright light up to a very long distance for arbitrary lengths of time. 

Tent, environment 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

As tent, but filters out poisonous atmospheres. Can be used in vacuum in an emergency for a few hours of air, but the taut fabric is given to tearing (GM intrusions triggered by rolling a 1 on d20 cause it to rip). 

Repair tape roll 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As duct tape, but programmable matter embedded in fabric provides two assets to all tasks related to repair using the tape and taping things together. Each roll has about ten uses. 

Self-extending rope

A fully functional prosthetic arm and hand, which could replace a lost limb, or be wired into user’s nervous system, which gives the user an additional gripping appendage useful in a variety of situations where other people would have their hands full. Attacks (and other tasks requiring precise dexterity) made with an exo-hand are hindered by two steps. 

Fusion battery 

level 5 (15)

Very Expensive 

This mobile fusion power source (with metal handles for easy transport) masses about 30 kg (70 pounds); it generates power through fusion. Provides power to nearly any device short of a spacecraft for a variable period depending on power requirements.

Fusion torch 

level 5 (15) 

Very Expensive 

Cuts through substances of up to level 9 after a few rounds of application. 

4D printer 

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

Prints a variety of basic objects, including protein bars, parts, wires, tools, and even small powered devices and equipment of up to level 4 and that are expensive or less. Requires special feedstock, which is an expensive cost to replace after every dozen or so uses, though items printed by the 4D printer can be recycled, extending the feedstock supply accordingly. Many long-haul spacecraft seek to obtain a 4D printer because having one significantly reduces the amount of material that must otherwise be carried.

## FANTASTIC

Carryall pack 

level 5 (15) 

Expensive 

As backpack, but dimensional folding allows for an arbitrary number of objects to be stored inside, so long as they fit the carryall pack’s 60 cm (2 foot) diameter mouth.

Instabulb, coffee 

level 3 (9) 

Inexpensive 

Coin-like disc; percolates and swells when water is added, becoming a sealed bulb filled with aromatic hot coffee. Other beverages can be had in the same form factor, suitable for travel and drinking in zero G. 

Mega bar 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

As trail rations, but bar either provides enough nutrition for one day of food or one free recovery roll. 

Serum, remedial 

level 3 (9) 

Moderate 

“Serum” is an often-used term for an ampule of artificially engineered blood and plasma that provides some kind of benefit. Serums of all types are generally dispensed from an autodoc, but may also be obtained as individual units, or in packs or cases. An ampule of remedial serum grants the user 3 points they can add to any Pool. It also has the benefit of relieving hangover symptoms. 

Serum, space-fit 

level 4 (12) 

Moderate 

As remedial serum, but protects against the two most common dangers to human physiology from extended trips into space and long-term exposure to zero G and radiation, which most notably include DNA breakage from cosmic rays and bone and muscle deterioration from microgravity. An ampule of space-fit serum lasts for about a month.

Serum, acceleration 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As remedial serum, but allows user to ignore the many deleterious physiological effects of acceleration and high-G maneuvers (of up to 15 Gs) for one hour (or of up to 20 Gs for a few minutes). Users are likely unable to move under high G, but won’t pass out, have a stroke, cardiac arrest, etc.—at least, not immediately. Prolonged use may still lead to all these outcomes. 

Serum, antivenom 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As remedial serum, but grants a Might task eased by four steps to withstand and clear poison from the user’s system and provides similar poison resistance for one day. 

Sleep set 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

A thin metallic (but comfortable, padded) headset that rests on the temples and induces a deep (dreamless) sleep state for a specified period, usually no more than three to six hours. Fail-safes can be set to bring a user out of sleep if loud noises, movement, someone addresses the sleeper, or other triggers occur. Users find themselves extremely well rested after each use. 

Transplant, organ or limb 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

If an autodoc or more advanced facility is available, a lost limb or organ can be replaced. Replaced limbs eventually become equally effective as the original, with practice. However, the mechanical (or possibly force-grown) prosthetic limbs initially hinders all physical tasks attempted using it for several weeks. 

Autodoc, mobile 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Pack-sized kit that eases any healing task, or up to four free recovery rolls. Also usually has a variety of serum types. (Each use requires a depletion roll of 1 on a d10; if depleted, autodoc supplies are used up, and it must be refilled as an expensive cost.) 

Hibernation pod 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

A pod large enough to contain a human, with internal mechanisms and power able to safely put a person into a deep state of arrested metabolism for about a hundred years, unless the program ends sooner or the pod is opened from the exterior. Each hundred years thereafter, the hibernating human must succeed on a Might defense task. The difficulty begins at 1, but increases by +1 every few hundred years that pass. 

Omnichair 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

Provides user full mobility via combination of micro thrusters, retractable wheels, and maglev levitation in all environments (from microgravity to full gravity), often contains a variety of tools and enhancements that grant the user assets to common tasks (possibly including a built-in weapon system). If customized to do so for an additional very expensive cost, can extend a fairing, enabling the omnichair to act as a sort of space suit/miniature spacecraft at need. 

Autodoc 

level 5 (15) 

Exorbitant 

As mobile autodoc, but fixed in place (suitable for a starcraft or station sickbay), and grants essentially unlimited recovery rolls or serum injections to anyone who spends at least an hour immobilized on the autodoc med table, even for the most minor of treatments.

## FANTASTIC

Nano tab, general 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Any of a variety of pill-like concentrations of nano-scale robots designed to activate once taken by mouth. Nano tab pills are usually designed for health interventions, though some also provide additional physical benefits. A general-use nano tab adds 1 to all recovery rolls made by user for one day.

Exorbitant 

As general nano tab, but permanently grants the benefits of an ampule of space-fit serum. 

Nano tab, immolating 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As general nano tab, but explosively distributes nano-threads deep into the body, turning it into mostly weaponry, effectively granting five posthuman upgrade power shifts. However, this quickly burns out the user, who dies within a solar standard month.

ROBOTS & AI

## CONTEMPORARY  
Electronic assistant 

level 2 (6) 

—/Moderate 

Anyone with a smartphone has some kind of built-in electronic assistant, though stand-alone versions can be had. Electronic assistants are voice activated and tie into the internet and any other connected systems, such as lights, door locks, furnaces, music speakers, and more. 

House robot 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

Any number of small automated devices that can vacuum, mop, or conduct similar routine tasks in a limited area. Includes embodied electronic assistants with some mobility, such as Jibo. 

PackBot 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant

Exorbitant 

An autonomous flying robot, which can also be remote controlled. Can record or relay its environment to distant controllers. An upgrade into the priceless category allows one to carry two or more self-guiding missiles that inflict 12 points of damage and drop unprotected targets two steps on the damage track. 

## ADVANCED

Auton

 level 1 (3) 

Moderate 

The generic term “auton” refers to a smart robot, one able to exist in the world as a full-fledged entity, though not nearly so competent as a true AI. On the other hand, autons come very close to having self-awareness, and some have probably achieved it. The variety of autons is staggering, given that they can be trained in nearly any task. Autons also come in a variety of shapes and colors, which vary based on culture and tech level. Though most can move on treads or legs to follow their owners as directed, some autons are housed in drone-like chassis using either rotors or microthrusters, allowing them to fly rather than move on the ground. Treat a basic auton as a level 1 follower, which allows the auton modifications in one task. 

Auton, aide 

level 2 (6)

 Expensive 

Treat as a level 2 follower, which allows the auton modifications in up to two tasks, depending on the particular aide. 

Auton, medical 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As auton, but one modification is always healing. A medical auton also incorporates a mobile autodoc. 

Auton, defense 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As auton, but one modification is always Speed defense, which means when helping to defend a target from a physical attack, the target eases the task by two steps. A defense auton also has 3 Armor. 

Auton, military drone 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant 

As defense auton or warrior auton, but miniaturized and able to fly in gravity to support owner. 

Auton, warrior 

level 2 (6) 

Exorbitant

 As auton, but one modification is always in attacks, which means when helping a target to make an attack, the target eases the task by two steps. However, warrior autons usually attack autonomously as level 3 entities with a ranged or melee weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage. 

Shipmind 

level 3 (9) 

Exorbitant x2 

A shipmind is a sim AI that exists within a single spacecraft or starship, with the ability to control many aspects of vehicle functions as necessary to supplement a crew, or sometimes in lieu of a crew. Shipminds each have their own simulated personality, emulating consciousness, though in most cases, they are not actually conscious. Having a shipmind installed on a spacecraft is immensely helpful, as it can oversee many basic functions. A shipmind usually accomplishes tasks at the level of the ship in which it is installed.

## FANTASTIC  
Synth 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive Synths are a blend of biological and mechanical parts so advanced that in some cases it’s impossible to tell the difference between a living creature and a synth. They are strong AIs in physical bodies. Other varieties of synths are constructed (or have modified themselves) to make it obvious they are not biological. In any case, synths are often sturdier and longer lasting than an average biological entity. Even so, in some settings, synths are relegated to being servitors, as if they were simple robots and autons. In other settings, a few, some, or all humans have long ago migrated into synth bodies, leaving their biology behind in prehistory, and becoming posthuman. Treat as a level 3 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up to three tasks, depending on the particular synth. At minimum, all synths have 2 Armor and regain 1 point of lost health per round if damaged. 

Synth, companion 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

As synth, but treat as a level 4 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up to four tasks. 

Synth, free

level 5 (15) 

Expensive\* 

As companion synth, but with modifications for up to five tasks. \*A free synth usually can’t be purchased, by definition, but can be hired on a contract basis, as an expensive cost for each week of service required. 

Wardroid 

level 6 (18) 

Exorbitant 

As free synth, but outfitted for war, including modifications in attack and defense. A wardroid often has many additional customizations and abilities. 

Synth, infiltrator 

level 7 (21) 

Priceless 

As free synth, but with modifications focusing on stealth, disguise, and tasks related to gaining entry to guarded locations for purposes of spying or assassination. Synth infiltrators have systems that allow them to change their apparent (or even actual) shape completely over the course of a minute to appear as another creature or innocuous object.

## RECREATION

Occasional recreation is absolutely necessary to maintain stable relationships as well as mental stability and happiness. Characters that never engage in recreation become gradually more unhappy and troubled, and eventually find interaction tasks and most Intellect tasks hindered unexpectedly.

## CONTEMPORARY  
Book 

level 2 (6) 

Inexpensive 

Print, digital, or audio; once perused for at least ten minutes, grants an asset to relaxation tasks. 

Card/tabletop/digital game 

level 2 (6)

Inexpensive/Moderate 

Suitable for passing the time and building bonds between friends and strangers alike. 

Alcohol/drugs 

level 2 (6) 

Inexpensive/Moderate/Expensive 

Common intoxicants taken in moderation can raise spirits, easing tasks related to social interaction while at the same time hindering tasks related to perception and physical coordination. Excessive amounts cancel out the benefit to social interaction and hinder all tasks by two or more steps, making even routine tasks a challenge. Extended excessive use can lead to addiction, a long-term disease difficult to recover from. 

Other kinds of drugs have a different ease and hinder profile. For example, the dose of caffeine in a cup of coffee can ease tasks related to concentration and motivation but hinder tasks related to resisting anxiety and irritability. On the other hand, addiction to caffeine normally isn’t nearly as serious an addiction as alcohol or opioids.

## ADVANCED

Sidekick sphere 

level 2 (6) 

Moderate 

Circuit-inscribed, and jauntily decorated, smart-material sphere about 1 m (3 feet) in diameter that rolls or jumps to stay within an immediate distance of owner. Capable of playing music, pulsing with light, engaging in witty conversation, and in keeping confidence. Treat the sidekick sphere as a level 2 follower (and limited sim AI). 

Tattoo, programmable 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

With time and talent, someone with a programmable tattoo implant can completely alter the designs that appear on their skin, modifying lines and color. A small alteration requires only a few rounds, but a full-body tattoo change, assuming any artistry at all is involved, may take a few days to complete. 

## FANTASTIC

Tattoo, living 

level 3 (9) 

Expensive 

As programmable tattoo, but images can be animated to run in a loop, or visually respond with limited reactivity to certain audible or other cues. Some come implanted with sim AIs for conversation and interaction.

Pleasure bit 

level 4 (12) 

Expensive 

Handheld device emits magnetic induction field that activates the reward circuit in the user’s brain, creating sudden ecstasy and joy for a pre-set period of time. Addiction is possible, though better models have an ebbing mode that helps put users back into their right minds gradually.

## ARMAMENTS LISTING

A selection of weapons for your sci-fi setting rated by level, price, function, and tech level

ARMAMENT AMMUNITION & CHARGE

Weapons require ammunition (“ammo”), whether that’s rounds of a particular caliber, energy packs, or something even more exotic. You can handle ammo requirements for weapons in one of three ways: exact tracking, abstracted monthly upkeep cost, or not worrying about it. 

Exact tracking means asking the character to track their available and used rounds/shots after (and possibly during) a fight. 

Abstracted monthly upkeep cost assumes that the characters go through ammo at an average rate, and obtaining more ammo or energy packs is something they do in their “off-camera” time. The monthly upkeep cost for ammo should equal about two steps less in price category than the weapon in question. 

Or you can just not worry about keeping track of ammunition, especially in games where gunplay isn’t common.

## CONTEMPORARY

Ammo (box of 50 rounds) 

level 1 (3)

Inexpensive 

Caliber varies by specific firearm, used in most contemporary ranged weapons

## ADVANCED/FANTASTIC  
Energy pack (50 shots) 

level 1 (3)

Inexpensive 

Watt-hours (Wh) varies by specific energy weapon, used in most advanced and fantastic ranged weapons. 

Smart rounds (box of 4 rounds) 

level 4 (12) 

Very Expensive 

A smart round can be used to make one normal attack plus up to 3 additional ricochet attacks on targets within short range of the attacker and each other as one action. Each ricochet attack successively increases the GM intrusion range by 2. If a GM intrusion is triggered, the ricochet attack hits something other than what the attacker intended, such as an important system or ally.

A character who uses a smart round on a group of foes could attempt to attack up to 4 of them with one shot; however, the GM intrusion range on the last ricochet attack would be 1–7 on the d20.

## MELEE WEAPONS

Any weapon that a character must use by swinging or stabbing at a target within immediate range is considered a melee weapon. Most contemporary melee weapons rely on the strength of the wielder.

## BLASTER WEAPONS  
Optional Blaster Rule as the Default: The advantage that blaster weapons have over other projectile and coherent light weapons is their ability to penetrate targets, which renders Armor less effective. This optional rule is presented as the default rule in The Stars Are Fire to demonstrate their superior tech level even over advanced tech weapons.

## CYPHER SHORTS

Cypher Shorts are what we call quick and easy adventures for use with the Cypher

System. The idea here is an adventure with very quick character creation and minimal GM prep, designed for a one-shot game that can be finished in a single session of three to four hours. If a typical campaign is an ongoing television series, think of a Cypher Short as a movie.

Cypher Shorts is a supplement for the Cypher System. You need the Cypher System Rulebook to play.

There are some key concepts to a Cypher Short that you’ll want to keep in mind if you’re playing, running, or creating one for yourself. They include:

- Very simple characters that are immediately involved in the situation. No long expository lead-ins, no “meet in a tavern” scenes.

- Characters have clear objectives, and there’s no thought to character advancement. This is a one-shot game, and we aren’t concerned about what came before or what comes after.

- There is less of a plot than there is a situation. Plot implies a linear direction: “This happens, then this, then this.” Cypher Shorts are meant to be framed more like: “You’re involved in this situation, so what do you do?”

- Just as players should use improvisation to react to and deal with situations they didn’t know were coming, the GM should be ready to do the same.
